			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>Then arose old Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his feet upon the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the island washed by ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broad expanse devoid of verdure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There remained he many summers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There he lived as many winters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the island vast and vacant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well considered, long reflected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who for him should sow the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who for him the seeds should scatter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought at last of Pellerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First-born of the plains and prairies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a slender boy, called Sampsa,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who should sow the vacant island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who the forest seeds should scatter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pellerwoinen, thus consenting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sows with diligence the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeds upon the lands he scatters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeds in every swamp and lowland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forest seeds upon the loose earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the firm soil sows the acorns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fir-trees sows he on the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pine-trees also on the hill-tops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many shrubs in every valley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Birches sows he in the marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the loose soil sows the alders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the lowlands sows the lindens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the moist earth sows the willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mountain-ash in virgin places,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the banks of streams the hawthorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Junipers in hilly regions;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the work of Pellerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slender Sampsa, in his childhood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon the fertile seeds were sprouting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon the forest trees were growing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon appeared the tops of fir-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the pines were far outspreading;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Birches rose from all the marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the loose soil grew the alders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mellow soil the lindens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Junipers were also growing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Junipers with clustered berries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Berries on the hawthorn branches.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the hero, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stands aloft to look about him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the Sampsa-seeds are growing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the crop of Pellerwoinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees the young trees thickly spreading,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees the forest rise in beauty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the oak-tree has not sprouted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tree of heaven is not growing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still within the acorn sleeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its own happiness enjoying.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he waited three nights longer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as many days he waited,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waited till a week had vanished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then again the work examined;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the oak-tree was not growing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had not left her acorn-dwelling.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spies four maidens in the distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Water-brides, he spies a fifth-one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the soft and sandy sea-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dewy grass and flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a point extending seaward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the forests of the island.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some were mowing, some were raking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raking what was mown together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a windrow on the meadow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the ocean rose a giant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mighty Tursas, tall and hardy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pressed compactly all the grasses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the maidens had been raking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a fire within them kindles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the flames shot up to heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the windrows burned to ashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only ashes now remaining</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the grasses raked together.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the ashes of the windrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tender leaves the giant places,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the leaves he plants an acorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the acorn, quickly sprouting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grows the oak-tree, tall and stately,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the ground enriched by ashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Newly raked by water-maidens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread the oak-tree’s many branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rounds itself a broad corona,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raises it above the storm-clouds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far it stretches out its branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stops the white-clouds in their courses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its branches hides the sunlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its many leaves, the moonbeams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the starlight dies in heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought awhile, and well considered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to kill the mighty oak-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First created for his pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to fell the tree majestic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to lop its hundred branches.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sad the lives of man and hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sad the homes of ocean-dwellers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the sun shines not upon them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the moonlight does not cheer them!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is there not some mighty hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was there never born a giant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can fell the mighty oak-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can lop its hundred branches?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen, deeply thinking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words soliloquizing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Kapé, daughter of the Ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient mother of my being,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Luonnotar, my nurse and helper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loan to me the water-forces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great the powers of the waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loan to me the strength of oceans,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To upset this mighty oak-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To uproot this tree of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That again may shine the sunlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the moon once more may glimmer.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Straightway rose a form from ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose a hero from the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor belonged he to the largest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor belonged he to the smallest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long was he as man’s forefinger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taller than the hand of woman;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his head a cap of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boots upon his feet were copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gloves upon his hands were copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And its stripes were copper-colored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Belt around him made of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hatchet in his belt was copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the handle of his hatchet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was as long as hand of woman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a finger’s breadth the blade was.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the trusty Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought awhile and well considered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his measures are as follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Art thou, sir, divine or human?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which of these thou only knowest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me what thy name and station.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Very like a man thou lookest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast the bearing of a hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though the length of man’s first finger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce as tall as hoof of reindeer.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then again spake Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the form from out the ocean:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Verily I think thee human,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the race of pygmy-heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might as well be dead or dying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fit for nothing but to perish.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Answered thus the pygmy-hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the small one from the ocean</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the valiant Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Truly am I god and hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the tribes that rule the ocean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come I here to fell the oak-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lop its branches with my hatchet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answers thus the sea-born hero:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Never hast thou force sufficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to thee has strength been given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To uproot this mighty oak-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To upset this thing of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor to lop its hundred branches.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scarcely had he finished speaking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarcely had he moved his eyelids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the pygmy full unfolding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick becomes a mighty giant.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With one step he leaves the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plants himself, a mighty hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the forest-fields surrounding;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his head the clouds he pierces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his knees his beard extending,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his locks fall to his ankles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far apart appear his eyeballs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far apart his feet are stationed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farther still his mighty shoulders.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now begins his axe to sharpen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly to an edge he whets it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Using six hard blocks of sandstone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of softer whetstones, seven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway to the oak-tree turning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thither stalks the mighty giant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his raiment long and roomy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flapping in the winds of heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his second step he totters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the land of darker color;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his third stop firmly planted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reaches he the oak-tree’s branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes the trunk with sharpened hatchet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With one mighty swing he strikes it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a second blow he cuts it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As his blade descends the third time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his axe the sparks fly upward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the oak-tree fire outshooting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the axe descends a fourth time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yields the oak with hundred branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shaking earth and heaven in falling.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eastward far the trunk extending,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far to westward flew the tree-tops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the South the leaves were scattered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the North its hundred branches.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whosoe’er a branch has taken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has obtained eternal welfare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who secures himself a tree-top,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He has gained the master magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who the foliage has gathered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has delight that never ceases.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the chips some had been scattered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scattered also many splinters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue back of the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the ocean smooth and mirrored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocked there by the winds and waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a boat upon the billows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Storm-winds blew them to the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some the ocean currents carried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Northland’s fair and slender maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Washing on the shore a head-dress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beating on the rocks her garments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rinsing there her silken raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the waters of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There beheld the chips and splinters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carried by the winds and waters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a bag the chips she gathered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took them to the ancient court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to make enchanted arrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arrows for the great magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to shape them into weapons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weapons for the skilful archer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since the mighty oak has fallen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now has lost its hundred branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the North may see the sunshine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See the gentle gleam of moonlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the clouds may keep their courses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May extend the vault of heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over every lake and river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the banks of every island.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Groves arose in varied beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautifully grew the forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And again, the vines and flowers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Birds again sang in the tree-tops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Noisily the merry thrushes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the cuckoos in the birch-trees;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the mountains grew the berries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden flowers in the meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the herbs of many colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many kinds of vegetation;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the barley is not growing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goes away and well considers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the borders of the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the ocean’s sandy margin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds six seeds of golden barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even seven ripened kernels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the shore of upper Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sand upon the sea-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hides them in his trusty pouches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fashioned from the skin of squirrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some were made from skin of marten;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens forth the seeds to scatter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly sows the barley kernels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the brinks of Kalew-waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the Osma-hills and lowlands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hark! the titmouse wildly crying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the aspen, words as follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Osma’s barley will not flourish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the barley of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the soil be not made ready,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the forest be not levelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the branches burned to ashes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made himself an axe for chopping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then began to clear the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then began the trees to level,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Felled the trees of all descriptions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only left the birch-tree standing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the birds a place of resting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where might sing the sweet-voiced cuckoo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sacred bird in sacred branches.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down from heaven came the eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the air he came a-flying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he might this thing consider;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he spake the words that follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wherefore, ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast thou left the slender birch-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left the birch-tree only standing?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen thus made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Therefore is the birch left standing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the birds may nest within it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the eagle there may rest him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There may sing the sacred cuckoo.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the eagle, thus replying:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good indeed, thy hero-judgment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the birch-tree thou hast left us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left the sacred birch-tree standing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a resting-place for eagles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for birds of every feather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even I may rest upon it.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly then this bird of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kindled fire among the branches;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon the flames are fanned by north-winds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the east-winds lend their forces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burn the trees of all descriptions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burn them all to dust and ashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only is the birch left standing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings his magic grains of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings he forth his seven seed-grains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings them from his trusty pouches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fashioned from the skin of squirrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some were made from skin of marten.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence to sow his seeds he hastens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastes the barley-grains to scatter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks unto himself these measures:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I the seeds of life am sowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sowing through my open fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the hand of my Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this soil enriched with ashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this soil to sprout and flourish.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient mother, thou that livest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far below the earth and ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mother of the fields and forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring the rich soil to producing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring the seed-grains to the sprouting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the barley well may flourish.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never will the earth unaided,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yield the ripe nutritious barley;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never will her force be wanting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the givers give assistance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the givers grace the sowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grace the daughters of creation.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise, O earth, from out thy slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the slumber-land of ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the barley-grains be sprouting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the blades themselves be starting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the verdant stalks be rising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the ears themselves be growing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a hundredfold producing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my plowing and my sowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my skilled and honest labor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ukko, thou O God, up yonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou O Father of the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou that livest high in Ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Curbest all the clouds of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Holdest in the air thy counsel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Holdest in the clouds good counsel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the East dispatch a cloudlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the North-east send a rain-cloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the West another send us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the North-west, still another,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly from the South a warm-cloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the rain may fall from heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the clouds may drop their honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the ears may fill and ripen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the barley-fields may rustle.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon benignant Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ukko, father of the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held his counsel in the cloud-space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held good counsel in the Ether;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the East, he sent a cloudlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the North-east, sent a rain-cloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the West another sent he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the North-west, still another,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly from the South a warm-cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joined in seams the clouds together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sewed together all their edges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grasped the cloud, and hurled it earthward.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the rain-cloud drops her honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the rain-drops fall from heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the ears may quickly ripen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the barley crop may rustle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway grow the seeds of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the germ the blade unfolding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Richly colored ears arising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the rich soil of the fallow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the work of Wainamoinen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here a few days pass unnoted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as many nights fly over.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the seventh day had journeyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the morning of the eighth day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went to view his crop of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How his plowing, how his sowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How his labors were resulting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found his crop of barley growing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found the blades were triple-knotted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the ears he found six-sided.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned his face, and looked about him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! there comes a spring-time cuckoo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spying out the slender birch-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rests upon it, sweetly singing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wherefore is the silver birch-tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left unharmed of all the forest?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Therefore I have left the birch-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left the birch-tree only growing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Home for thee for joyful singing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call thou here, O sweet-voiced cuckoo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing thou here from throat of velvet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing thou here with voice of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the cuckoo’s golden flute-notes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call at morning, call at evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call within the hour of noontide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the better growth of forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the ripening of the barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the richness of, the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the joy of Kalevala.”</span>
