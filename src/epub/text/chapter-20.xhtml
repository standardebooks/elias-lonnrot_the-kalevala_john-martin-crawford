				<span>Now we sing the wondrous legends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Songs of wedding-feasts and dances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the melodies of wedlock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the songs of old tradition;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing of Ilmarinen’s marriage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Maiden of the Rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest daughter of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the drinking-songs of Pohya.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long prepared they for the wedding</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Pohyola’s halls and chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the courts of Sariola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many things that Louhi ordered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great indeed the preparations</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the marriage of the daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the feasting of the heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the drinking of the strangers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the feeding of the poor-folk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the people’s entertainment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grew an ox in far Karjala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the largest, nor the smallest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was the ox that grew in Suomi;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But his size was all-sufficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his tail was sweeping Jamen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his head was over Kemi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Horns in length a hundred fathoms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Longer than the horns his mouth was;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seven days it took a weasel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To encircle neck and shoulders;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One whole day a swallow journeyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From one horn-tip to the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not stop between for resting.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thirty days the squirrel travelled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the tail to reach the shoulders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he could not gain the horn-tip</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the Moon had long passed over.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This young ox of huge dimensions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This great calf of distant Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was conducted from Karjala</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the meadows of Pohyola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At each horn a hundred heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At his head and neck a thousand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the mighty ox was lassoed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led away to Northland pastures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peacefully the monster journeyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the bays of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ate the pasture on the borders;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the clouds arose his shoulders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his horns to highest heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not in all of Sariola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could a butcher be discovered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That could kill the ox for Louhi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None of all the sons of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her hosts of giant people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her rising generation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hosts of those grown older.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came a hero from a distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wirokannas from Karelen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these words the gray-beard uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wait, O wait, thou ox of Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till I bring my ancient war-club;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I’ll smite thee on thy forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Break thy skull, thou willing victim!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nevermore wilt thou in summer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Browse the woods of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bare our pastures, fields, and forests;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou, O ox, wilt feed no longer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the length and breadth of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the borders of this ocean!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the ancient Wirokannas</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Started out the ox to slaughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Palwoinen swung his war-club,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the victim turned his forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flashed his flaming eyes upon him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the fir-tree leaped the hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the thicket hid Palwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hid the gray-haired Wirokannas.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everywhere they seek a butcher,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One to kill the ox of Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the country of Karelen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And among the Suomi-giants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the quiet fields of Ehstland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the battle-fields of Sweden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mid the mountaineers of Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the magic fens of Turya;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seek him in Tuoni’s empire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the death-courts of Manala.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long the search, and unsuccessful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue back of the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the far-outstretching pastures.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There arose from out the sea-waves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose a hero from the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the white-capped, roaring breakers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the water’s broad expanses;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor belonged he to the largest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor belonged he to the smallest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made his bed within a sea-shell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood erect beneath a flour-sieve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hero old, with hands of iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his face was copper-colored;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the hero full unfolded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the full corn from the kernel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his head a hat of flint-stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his feet were sandstone-sandals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his hand a golden cleaver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the blade was copper-handled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus at last they found a butcher,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found the magic ox a slayer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing has been found so mighty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That it has not found a master.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the sea-god saw his booty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly rushed he on his victim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurled him to his knees before him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly felled the calf of Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Felled the young ox of Karelen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bountifully meat was furnished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled at least a thousand hogsheads</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his blood were seven boatfuls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a thousand weight of suet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the banquet of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the marriage-feast of Northland.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Pohyola was a guest-room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ample was the hall of Louhi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was in length a hundred furlongs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in breadth was nearly fifty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When upon the roof a rooster</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crowed at break of early morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one on the earth could hear him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the dog barked at one entrance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None could hear him at the other.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens to the hall and court-room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the centre speaks as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whence indeed will come the liquor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will brew me beer from barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will make the mead abundant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the people of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coming to my daughter’s marriage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To her drinking-feast and nuptials?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot comprehend the malting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never have I learned the secret,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the origin of brewing.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake an old man from his corner:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Beer arises from the barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comes from barley, hops, and water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the fire gives no assistance.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hop-vine was the son of Remu,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Small the seed in earth was planted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cultivated in the loose soil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scattered like the evil serpents</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the brink of Kalew-waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the Osmo-fields and borders.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the young plant grew and flourished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There arose the climbing hop-vine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clinging to the rocks and alders.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Man of good-luck sowed the barley</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the Osmo hills and lowlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the barley grew and flourished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grew and spread in rich abundance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fed upon the air and water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the Osmo plains and highlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the fields of Kalew-heroes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Time had travelled little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the hops in trees were humming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Barley in the fields was singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from Kalew’s well the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the language of the trio:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Let us join our triple forces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Join to each the other’s powers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sad alone to live and struggle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Little use in working singly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better we should toil together.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Osmotar, the beer-preparer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brewer of the drink refreshing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the golden grains of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taking six of barley-kernels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taking seven tips of hop-fruit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filling seven cups with water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the fire she sets the caldron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boils the barley, hops, and water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lets them steep, and seethe, and bubble</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brewing thus the beer delicious,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hottest days of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the foggy promontory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the island forest-covered;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poured it into birch-wood barrels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into hogsheads made of oak-wood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thus did Osmotar of Kalew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brew together hops and barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could not generate the ferment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thinking long and long debating,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus she spake in troubled accents:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘What will bring the effervescence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will add the needed factor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the beer may foam and sparkle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May ferment and be delightful?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kalevatar, magic maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grace and beauty in her fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swiftly moving, lightly stepping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her trimly-buckled sandals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steps upon the birch-wood bottom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turns one way, and then another,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the centre of the caldron;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds within a splinter lying</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the bottom lifts the fragment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turns it in her fingers, musing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘What may come of this I know not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hands of magic maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the virgin hands of Kapo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snowy virgin of the Northland!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Kalevatar took the splinter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the magic virgin, Kapo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who by unknown force and insight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rubbed her hands and knees together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And produced a snow-white squirrel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus instructed she her creature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave the squirrel these directions:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Snow-white squirrel, mountain-jewel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flower of the field and forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haste thee whither I would send thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into Metsola’s wide limits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into Tapio’s seat of wisdom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hasten through the heavy tree-tops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wisely through the thickest branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the eagle may not seize thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus escape the bird of heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me ripe cones from the fir-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the pine-tree bring me seedlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring them to the hands of Kapo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the beer of Osmo’s daughter.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly hastened forth the squirrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly sped the nimble broad-tail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swiftly hopping on its journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From one thicket to another,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the birch-tree to the aspen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the pine-tree to the willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the sorb-tree to the alder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Jumping here and there with method,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crossed the eagle-woods in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into Metsola’s wide limits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into Tapio’s seat of wisdom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There perceived three magic pine-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There perceived three smaller fir-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly climbed the dark-green branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not captured by the eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not mangled in his talons;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broke the young cones from the fir-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut the shoots of pine-tree branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hid the cones within his pouches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrapped them in his fur-grown mittens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought them to the hands of Kapo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the magic virgin’s fingers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kapo took the cones selected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid them in the beer for ferment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But it brought no effervescence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the beer was cold and lifeless.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Osmotar, the beer-preparer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kapo, brewer of the liquor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeply thought and long considered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘What will bring the effervescence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will lend me aid efficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the beer may foam and sparkle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May ferment and be refreshing?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Kalevatar, sparkling maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grace and beauty in her fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Softly moving, lightly stepping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her trimly-buckled sandals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steps again upon the bottom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turns one way and then another,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the centre of the caldron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees a chip upon the bottom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes it from its place of resting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looks upon the chip and muses</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘What may come of this I know not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hands of mystic maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hands of magic Kapo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the virgin’s snow-white fingers.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Kalevatar took the birch-chip</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the magic maiden, Kapo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave it to the white-faced maiden.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kapo, by the aid of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rubbed her hands and knees together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And produced a magic marten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the marten, golden-breasted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus instructed she her creature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave the marten these directions.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Thou, my golden-breasted marten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou my son of golden color,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haste thou whither I may send thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bear-dens of the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the grottoes of the growler,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gather yeast upon thy fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gather foam from lips of anger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the lips of bears in battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring it to the hands of Kapo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hands of Osmo’s daughter.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then the marten golden-breasted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full consenting, hastened onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly bounding on his journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lightly leaping through the distance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaping o’er the widest rivers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaping over rocky fissures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bear-dens of the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the grottoes of the growler,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the wild-bears fight each other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where they pass a dread existence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Iron rocks, their softest pillows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the fastnesses of mountains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From their lips the foam was dripping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From their tongues the froth of anger;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the marten deftly gathered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought it to the maiden, Kapo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid it in her dainty fingers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Osmotar, the beer-preparer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brewer of the beer of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Used the beer-foam as a ferment;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But it brought no effervescence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not make the liquor sparkle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Osmotar, the beer-preparer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought again, and long debated:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Who or what will bring the ferment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Th at my beer may not be lifeless?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Kalevatar, magic maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grace and beauty in her fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Softly moving, lightly stepping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her trimly-buckled sandals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steps again upon the bottom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turns one way and then another,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the centre of the caldron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees a pod upon the bottom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifts it in her snow-white fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turns it o’er and o’er, and muses:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘What may come of this I know not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hands of magic maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hands of mystic Kapo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the snowy virgin’s fingers?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Kalevatar, sparkling maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave the pod to magic Kapo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kapo, by the aid of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rubbed the pod upon her knee-cap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a honey-bee came flying</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the pod within her fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kapo thus addressed her birdling:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Little bee with honeyed winglets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King of all the fragrant flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly thou whither I direct thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the islands in the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the water-cliffs and grottoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where asleep a maid has fallen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Girdled with a belt of copper</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By her side are honey-grasses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By her lips are fragrant flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Herbs and flowers honey-laden;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gather there the sweetened juices,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gather honey on thy winglets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the calyces of flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the tips of seven petals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring it to the hands of Kapo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hands of Osmo’s daughter.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then the bee, the swift-winged birdling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew away with lightning-swiftness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his journey to the islands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the high waves of the ocean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Journeyed one day, then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Journeyed all the next day onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the third day evening brought him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the islands in the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the water-cliffs and grottoes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found the maiden sweetly sleeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her silver-tinselled raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Girdled with a belt of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a nameless meadow, sleeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the honey-fields of magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By her side were honeyed grasses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By her lips were fragrant flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silver stalks with golden petals;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dipped its winglets in the honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dipped its fingers in the juices</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the sweetest of the flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought the honey back to Kapo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the mystic maiden’s fingers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Osmotar, the beer-preparer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Placed the honey in the liquor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kapo mixed the beer and honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wedding-beer fermented;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose the live beer upward, upward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the bottom of the vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upward in the tubs of birch-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foaming higher, higher, higher,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till it touched the oaken handles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Overflowing all the caldrons;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the ground it foamed and sparkled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sank away in sand and gravel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Time had gone but little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce a moment had passed over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the heroes came in numbers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the foaming beer of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rushed to drink the sparkling liquor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere all others Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drank, and grew intoxicated</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the beer of Osmo’s daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the honey-drink of Kalew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Osmotar, the beer-preparer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kapo, brewer of the barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in saddened accents:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Woe is me, my life hard-fated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Badly have I brewed the liquor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have not brewed the beer in wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not live within its vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Overflows and fills Pohyola!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“From a tree-top sings the redbreast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the aspen calls the robin:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Do not grieve, thy beer is worthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put it into oaken vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into strong and willing barrels</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Firmly bound with hoops of copper.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thus was brewed the beer or Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the hands of Osmo’s daughter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the origin of brewing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beer from Kalew-hops and barley;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great indeed the reputation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the ancient beer of Kalew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said to make the feeble hardy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Famed to dry the tears of women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Famed to cheer the broken-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the aged young and supple,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the timid brave and mighty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the brave men ever braver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill the heart with joy and gladness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill the mind with wisdom-sayings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill the tongue with ancient legends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only makes the fool more foolish.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the hostess of Pohyola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard how beer was first fermented,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the origin of brewing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway did she fill with water</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many oaken tubs and barrels;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled but half the largest vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mixed the barley with the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Added also hops abundant;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well she mixed the triple forces</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her tubs of oak and birch-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heated stones for months succeeding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to boil the magic mixture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steeped it through the days of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burned the wood of many forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Emptied all the, springs of Pohya;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Daily did the, forests lesson,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wells gave up their waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to aid the hostess, Louhi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the brewing of the liquors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the water, hops, and barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from honey of the islands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the wedding-feast of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Pohyola’s great carousal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rejoicings at the marriage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Malden of the Rainbow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Metal-worker of Wainola.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smoke is seen upon the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire, upon the promontory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Black smoke rising to the heavens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fire upon the island;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fills with clouds the half of Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fills Karelen’s many hamlets;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the people look and wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the chorus of the women:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whence are rising all these smoke-clouds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why this dreadful fire in Northland?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is not like the smoke of camp-fires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is too large for fires of shepherds!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s ancient mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Journeyed in the early morning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For some water to the fountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the smoke arise to heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the region of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words the mother uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“’Tis the smoke of battle-heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the beat of warring armies!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even Ahti, island-hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient wizard, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Also known as Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked upon the scene in wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought awhile and spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I would like to see this nearer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Learn the cause of all this trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence this smoke and great confusion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether smoke from heat of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the bonfires of the shepherds.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kaukomieli gazed and pondered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Studied long the rising smoke-clouds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came not from the heat of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came not from the shepherd bonfires;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard they were the fires of Louhi</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brewing beer in Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Pohyola’s promontory;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long and oft looked Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strained in eagerness his vision,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stared, and peered, and thought, and wondered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked abashed and envy-swollen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O beloved, second mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Northland’s well-intentioned hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brew thy beer of honey-flavor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make thy liquors foam and sparkle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thy many friends invited,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brew it well for Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his marriage in Pohyola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the Maiden of the Rainbow.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finally the beer was ready,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beverage of noble heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stored away in casks and barrels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to rest awhile in silence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the cellars of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the copper-banded vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the magic oaken hogsheads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plugs and faucets made of copper.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the hostess of Pohyola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skilfully prepared the dishes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid them all with careful fingers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the boiling-pans and kettles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ordered countless loaves of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ordered many liquid dishes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the delicacies of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the feasting of her people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For their richest entertainment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the nuptial songs and dances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the marriage of her daughter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the blacksmith, Ilmarinen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the loaves were baked and ready.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the dishes all were seasoned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Time had gone but little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce a moment had passed over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the beer, in casks imprisoned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loudly rapped, and sang, and murmured:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come, ye heroes, come and take me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come and let me cheer your spirits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make you sing the songs of wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That with honor ye may praise me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the songs of beer immortal!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway Louhi sought a minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Magic bard and artist-singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the beer might well be lauded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might be praised in song and honor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First as bard they brought a salmon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Also brought a pike from ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the salmon had no talent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the pike had little wisdom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Teeth of pike and gills of salmon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were not made for singing legends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then again they sought a singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Magic minstrel, beer-enchanter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to praise the drink of heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the songs of joy and gladness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a boy was brought for singing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the boy had little knowledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could not praise the beer in honor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Children’s tongues are filled with questions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Children cannot speak in wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot sing the ancient legends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stronger grew the beer imprisoned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the copper-banded vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Locked behind the copper faucets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boiled, and foamed, and sang, and murmured:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If ye do not bring a singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will sing my worth immortal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will sing my praise deserving,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will burst these bands of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burst the heads of all these barrels;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not serve the best of heroes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he sings my many virtues.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called a trusted maiden-servant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent her to invite the people</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the marriage of her daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words that Louhi uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O my trusted, truthful maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Servant-maid to me belonging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call together all my people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call the heroes to my banquet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ask the rich, and ask the needy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ask the blind and deaf, and crippled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ask the young, and ask the aged;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go thou to the hills, and hedges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the highways, and the by-ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Urge them to my daughter’s wedding;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring the blind, and sorely troubled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my boats upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my sledges bring the halting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the old, and sick, and needy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ask the whole of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ask the people of Karelen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ask the ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Famous bard and wisdom-singer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I give command explicit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to ask wild Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the island-dweller, Ahti!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the question of the servant:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why not ask wild Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient islander and minstrel?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Louhi gave this simple answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good the reasons that I give thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why the wizard, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must not have an invitation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my daughter’s feast and marriage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ahti courts the heat of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen fosters trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skilful fighter of the virtues;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evil thinking, acting evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would bring but pain and sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would jest and jeer at maidens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In their trimly buckled raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot ask the evil-minded!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus again the servant questions:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tell me how to know this Ahti,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Also known as Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I may not ask him hither;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not know the isle of Ahti,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the home of Kaukomieli</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Easy ’tis to know the wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Easy find the Ahti-dwelling:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ahti lives on yonder island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On that point dwells Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his mansion near the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far at sea his home and dwelling.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon the trusted maiden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread the wedding-invitations</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the people of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the tribes of Kalevala;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked the friendless, asked the homeless</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked the laborers and shepherds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked the fishermen and hunters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked the deaf, the dumb, the crippled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked the young, and asked the aged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked the rich, and asked the needy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not give an invitation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the reckless Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Island-dweller of the ocean.</span>
