			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the reckless son of Lempo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the sea’s smooth plain departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the far-extending waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the village, cold and dreary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the never-pleasant Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the heroes fall and perish.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen led the rowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On one side the magic war-ship,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the reckless Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led the rowers on the other.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and trusty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid his hand upon the rudder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steered his vessel o’er the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the foam and angry billows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Pohyola’s place of landing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cylinders of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the war-ships lie at anchor.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they had arrived at Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When their journey they had ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the land they rolled their vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the copper-banded rollers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway journeyed to the village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to the halls and hamlets</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the dismal Sariola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed the stranger-heroes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Magic heroes of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the tidings ye are bringing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the people of my village?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave this answer to the hostess:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“All the hosts of Kalevala</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are inquiring for the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asking for the lid in colors;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither have these heroes journeyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To divide the priceless treasure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the hostess spake in answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No one would divide a partridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor a squirrel, with three heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wonderful the magic Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plenty does it bring to Northland;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the colored lid re-echoes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the copper-bearing mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the stone-berg of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the joy of its possessors.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed the ancient Louhi:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If thou wilt not share the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give to us an equal portion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We will take it to Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its lid of many colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take by force the hope of Pohya.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the Northland hostess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Angry grew and sighed for vengeance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called her people into council,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called the hosts of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heroes with their trusted broadswords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To destroy old Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his people of the Northland.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to his harp of fish-bone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And began his magic playing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All of Pohya stopped and listened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every warrior was silenced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the notes of the magician;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peaceful-minded grew the soldiers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the maidens danced with pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the heroes fell to weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the young men looked in wonder.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen plays unceasing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plays the maidens into slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plays to sleep the young and aged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All of Northland sleeps and listens.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wise and wondrous Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal bard and singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Searches in his pouch of leather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Draws therefrom his slumber-arrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Locks the eyelids of the sleepers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the heroes of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings and charms to deeper slumber</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the warriors of the Northland.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the heroes of Wainola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hasten to obtain the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To procure the lid in colors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the copper-bearing mountains.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From behind nine locks of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the stone-berg of Pohyola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then began his wondrous singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang in gentle tones of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the entrance to the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the border of the stronghold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trembled all the rocky portals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the iron-banded pillars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell and crumbled at his singing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen, magic blacksmith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well anointed all the hinges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the bars and locks anointed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the bolts flew back by magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the gates unlocked in silence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Opened for the great magician.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the minstrel Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou daring Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Friend of mine in times of trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enter thou within the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring away the wondrous Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring away the lid in colors!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick the reckless Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever ready for a venture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens to the mountain-caverns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to find the famous Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to get the lid in colors;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strides along with conscious footsteps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus himself he vainly praises:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Great am I and full of glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wonder-hero, son of Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will bring away the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn about the lid in colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn it on its magic hinges!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen finds the wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds the Sampo in the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Labors long with strength heroic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tugs with might and main to turn it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Motionless remains the treasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeper sinks the lid in colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the roots have grown about it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grown nine fathoms deep in sand-earth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lived a mighty ox in Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Powerful in bone and sinew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful in form and color,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Horns the length of seven fathoms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mouth and eyes of wondrous beauty.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen, reckless hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harnesses the ox in pasture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the master-plow of Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plows the roots about the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plows around the lid in colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sacred Sampo loosens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls the colored lid in silence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway ancient Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings the daring Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lastly brings the magic Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the stone-berg of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the copper-bearing mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hides it in his waiting vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the war-ship of Wainola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen called his people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called his crew of men and maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called together all his heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolled his vessel to the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into billowy deeps and dangers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whither shall we take the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither take the lid in colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the stone-berg of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From this evil spot of Northland?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, wise and faithful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave this answer to the question:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thither shall we take the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thither take the lid in colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the fog-point on the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the island forest-covered;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the treasure may be hidden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May remain in peace for ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Free from trouble, free from danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the sword will not molest it.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the minstrel, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joyful, left the Pohya borders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Homeward sailed, and happy-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these measures on departing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Turn, O man-of-war, from Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn thy back upon the strangers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn thou to my distant country!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rock, O winds, my magic vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Homeward drive my ship, O billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lend the rowers your assistance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give the oarsmen easy labor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this vast expanse of waters!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give me of thine oars, O Ahto,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lend thine aid, O King of sea-waves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guide as with thy helm in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay thy hand upon the rudder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And direct our war-ship homeward;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the hooks of metal rattle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the surging of the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the white-capped waves’ commotion.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the master, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guided home his willing vessel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the lively Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led the mighty host of rowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the war-ship glided homeward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the sea’s unruffled surface,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the mighty waste of waters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Once before I rode these billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There were viands for the heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was singing for the maidens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to-day I hear no singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear no songs upon the vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear no music on the waters.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answered thus wild Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let none sing upon the blue-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the waters, no rejoicing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing would prolong our journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Songs disturb the host of rowers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon will die the silver sunlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Darkness soon will overtake us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this evil waste of waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this blue-sea, smooth and level.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Time will fly on equal pinions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether we have songs or silence;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon will disappear the daylight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the night as quickly follow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether we be sad or joyous.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, the magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the blue backs of the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steered one day, and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steered the third from morn till even,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the wizard, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once again addressed the master:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why wilt thou, O famous minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing no longer for thy people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since the Sampo thou hast captured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Captured too the lid in colors?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“ ’Tis not well to sing too early!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Time enough for songs of joyance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When we see our home-land mansions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When our journeyings have ended!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“At the helm, if I were sitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would sing at morn and evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though my voice has little sweetness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since thy songs are not forthcoming</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Listen to my wondrous singing!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raised his voice above the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the sea his song resounded;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But his measures were discordant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his notes were harsh and frightful.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the wizard, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Screeched the reckless Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the mighty war-ship trembled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far and wide was heard his singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard his songs upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard within the seventh village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard beyond the seven oceans.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sat a crane within the rushes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a hillock clothed in verdure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the crane his toes was counting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly he heard the singing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the wizard, Lemminkainen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the bird was justly frightened</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the songs of the magician.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then with horrid voice, and screeching,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew the crane across the broad-sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the lakes of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er Pohyola’s hills and hamlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Screeching, screaming, over Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the people of the darkness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were awakened from their slumbers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Louhi hastens to her hurdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens to her droves of cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens also to her garners,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Counts her herds, inspects her store-house;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Undisturbed she finds her treasures.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick she journeys to the entrance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the copper-bearing mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words as she approaches:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Woe is me, my life hard-fated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woe to Louhi, broken-hearted!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here the tracks of the destroyers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my locks and bolts are broken</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the hands of cruel strangers!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broken are my iron hinges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Open stand the mountain-portals</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leading to the Northland-treasure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has Pohyola lost her Sampo?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then she hastened to the chambers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the Sampo had been grinding;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she found the chambers empty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lid and Sampo gone to others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the stone-berg of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From behind nine locks of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the copper-bearing mountain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Angry grew and cried for vengeance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As she found her fame departing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found her-strength fast disappearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed the sea-fog virgin:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Daughter of the morning-vapors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sift thy fogs from distant cloud-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sift the thick air from the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sift thy vapors from the ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue-back of the broad-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the far extending waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Friend of ocean-wave and billow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not baffle his pursuers!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Should this prayer prove unavailing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raise thy head above the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And destroy Wainola’s heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sink them to thy deep sea-castles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There devour them at thy pleasure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring thou back the golden Sampo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the people of Pohyola!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Should these words be ineffective,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ukko, mightiest of rulers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden king beyond the welkin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting on a throne of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill thy skies with heavy storm-clouds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call thy fleetest winds about thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send them o’er the seven broad-seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to find the fleeing vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the ancient Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not baffle his pursuers!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick the virgin of the vapors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathed a fog upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made it settle on the war-ship</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the heroes of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held the minstrel, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anchored in the fog and darkness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound him one day, then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then a third till dawn of morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the middle of the blue-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence he could not flee in safety</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the wrath of his pursuers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the third night had departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Resting in the sea, and helpless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen spake as follows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not a man of strength and courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the weakest of the heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who upon the sea will suffer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sink and perish in the vapors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perish in the fog and darkness!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With his sword he smote the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his magic blade flowed honey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the vapor breaks, and rises,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaves the waters clear for rowing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far extend the sky and waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Large the ring of the horizon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the troubled sea enlarges.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Time had journeyed little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce a moment had passed over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they heard a mighty roaring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard a roaring and a rushing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the border of the vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the foam was shooting skyward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the boat of Wainamoinen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway youthful Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sank in gravest apprehension,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his cheeks the blood departed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pulled his cap down o’er his forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shook and trembled with emotion.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Casts his eyes upon the waters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the broad rim of his war-ship;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There perceives an ocean-wonder</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his head above the sea-foam.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, brave and mighty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seizes quick the water-monster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifts him by his ears and questions:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why art rising from the blue-sea?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherefore dost thou leave thy castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Show thyself to mighty heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the heroes of Wainola?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ocean monster, manifested</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither pleasure, nor displeasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not in the least affrighted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not give the hero answer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whereupon the ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked the second time the monster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Urgently inquired a third time:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why art rising from the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherefore dost thou leave the blue-sea?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Iku-Turso gave this answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For this cause I left my castle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Underneath the rolling billows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came I here with the intention</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To destroy the Kalew-heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And return the magic Sampo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the people of Pohyola.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou wilt restore my freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spare my life, from pain and sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will quick retrace my journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nevermore to show my visage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the people of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never while the moonlight glimmers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the hills of Kalevala!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the singer, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freed the monster, Iku-Turso,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent him to his deep sea-castles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words to him departing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Iku-Turso, son of Old-age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nevermore arise from ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nevermore let Northland-heroes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See thy face above the waters!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nevermore has Iku-Turso</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Risen to the ocean-level;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never since have Northland sailors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seen the head of this sea-monster.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Onward rowed his goodly vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Journeyed but a little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce a moment had passed over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the King of all creators,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mighty Ukko of the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the winds blow full of power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the storms arise in fury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made them rage upon the waters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the west the winds came roaring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the north-east came in anger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Winds came howling from the south-west,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came the winds from all directions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In their fury, rolling, roaring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tearing branches from the lindens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurling needles from the pine-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blowing flowers from the heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grasses blowing from the meadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tearing up the very bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roared the winds and lashed the waters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the waves were white with fury;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tossed the war-ship high in ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tossed away the harp of fish-bone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Magic harp of Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the joy of King Wellamo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the pleasure of his people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the happiness of Ahto,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ahto, rising from his caverns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the floods beheld his people</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carry off the harp of magic</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To their home below the billows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heavy-hearted, spake these measures:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have lost what I created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have lost the harp of joyance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now my strength has gone to others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my pleasure too departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my hope and comfort vanished!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nevermore the harp of fish-bone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will enchant the hosts of Suomi!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sorrow-laden, spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Woe is me, my life hard-fated!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would that I had never journeyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On these waters filled with dangers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the rolling waste before me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this war-ship false and feeble.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Winds and storms have I encountered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wretched days of toil and trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have witnessed in the Northland;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never have I met such dangers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the land, nor on the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never in my hero life-time!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the ancient Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake and these the words he uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Weep no more, my goodly comrades,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my bark let no one murmur;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeping cannot mend disaster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tears can never still misfortune,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mourning cannot save from evil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sea, command thy warring forces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bid thy children cease their fury!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ahto, still thy surging billows!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sink, Wellamo, to thy slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That our boat may move in safety.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise, ye storm-winds, to your kingdoms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lift your heads above the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the regions of your kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To your people and dominions;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut the trees within the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bend the lindens of the valley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let our vessel sail in safety!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the reckless Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome wizard, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in supplication:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come, O eagle, Turyalander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring three feathers from thy pinions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three, O raven, three, O eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To protect this bark from evil!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All the heroes of Wainola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call their forces to the rescue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And repair the sinking vessel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the aid of master-magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen saved his war-ship,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saved his people from destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well repaired his ship to battle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the roughest seas of Northland;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steers his mighty boat in safety</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the perils of the whirlpool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the watery deeps and dangers.</span>
