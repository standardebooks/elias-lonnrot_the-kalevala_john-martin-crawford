				<span>Ahti, hero of the Islands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild magician, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Also known as Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened from the great carousal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the banquet-halls of Louhi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the ever-darksome Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the dismal Sariola.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stormful strode he from the mansion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened like the smoke of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the court-yard of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left his crimes and misdemeanors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the halls of ancient Louhi.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he looked in all directions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeking for his tethered courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anxious looked in field and stable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he did not find his racer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found a black thing in the fallow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proved to be a clump of willows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will well advise the hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will give him wise directions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guide the wizard out of trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give his hero-locks protection,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep his magic head from danger</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the warriors of Northland?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Noise is heard within the village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a din from other homesteads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the battle-hosts of Louhi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streaming from the doors and window,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the homesteads of Pohyola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon young Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome Islander and hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Changing both his form and features,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clad himself in other raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Changing to another body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick became a mighty eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soared aloft on wings of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tried to fly to highest heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the moonlight burned his temples,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sunshine singed his feathers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then entreating, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Island-hero, turned to Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the prayer that Ahti uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ukko, God of love and mercy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou the Wisdom of the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wise Director of the lightning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou the Author of the thunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou the Guide of all the cloudlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give to me thy cloak of vapor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throw a silver cloud around me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I may in its protection</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hasten to my native country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my mother’s Island-dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly to her that waits my coming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a mother’s grave forebodings.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Farther, farther, Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew and soared on eagle-pinions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked about him, backwards, forwards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spied a gray-hawk soaring near him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his eyes the fire of splendor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the eyes of Pohyalanders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the eyes of Pohya’s spearmen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the gray-hawk thus addressed him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ho! there! hero, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art thou thinking of our combat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the hero-heads of Northland?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus the Islander made answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Kaukomieli:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou gray-hawk, bird of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly direct to Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly as fast as wings can bear thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thou hast arrived in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the plains of darksome Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell the archers and the spearmen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They will never catch the eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his journey from Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his Island-home and fortress.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the Ahti-eagle hastened</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway to his mother’s cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his face the look of trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his heart the pangs of sorrow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ahti’s mother ran to meet him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she spied him in the pathway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walking toward her island-dwelling;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words the mother uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Of my sons thou art the bravest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art the strongest of my children;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherefore then comes thine annoyance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On returning from Pohyola?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wert thou worsted at the banquet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the feast and great carousal?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At thy cups, if thou wert injured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt here have better treatment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt have the cup thy father</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought me from the hero-castle.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Worthy mother, thou that nursed me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I had been maimed at drinking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I the landlord would have worsted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would have slain a thousand heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would have taught them useful lessons.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wherefore then art thou indignant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Didst thou meet disgrace and insult,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did they rob thee of thy courser?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Buy thou then a better courser</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the riches of thy mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thy father’s horded treasures.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Faithful mother of my being,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If my steed had been insulted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If for him my heart was injured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I the landlord would have punished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would have punished all the horsemen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All of Pohya’s strongest riders.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tell me then thy dire misfortune,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What has happened to my hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his journey to Pohyola?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have the Northland maidens scorned thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have the women ridiculed thee?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the maidens scorned thy presence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the women gave derision,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There are others thou canst laugh at,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst scorn a thousand women.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said the reckless Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Honored mother, fond and faithful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the Northland dames had scorned me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the maidens laughed derision,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I the maidens would have punished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would have scorned a thousand women.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wherefore then are thou indignant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus annoyed, and heavy-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On returning from Pohyola?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was thy feasting out of season,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was the banquet-beer unworthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were thy dreams of evil import</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When asleep in darksome Northland?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is Lemminkainen’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Aged women may remember</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What they dream on beds of trouble;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have seen some wondrous visions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since I left my Island-cottage.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My beloved, helpful mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill my bag with good provisions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flour and salt in great abundance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farther must thy hero wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He must leave his home behind him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave his pleasant Island-dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Journey from this home of ages;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men are sharpening their broadswords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sharpening their spears and lances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the death of Lemminkainen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then again the mother questioned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurriedly she asked the reason:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why the men their swords were whetting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why their spears are being sharpened.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Therefore do they whet their broadswords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore sharpen they their lances:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is for thy son’s destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At his heart are aimed their lances.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the court-yard of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There arose a great contention,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fierce the battle waged against me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I slew the Northland hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Killed the host of Sariola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick to arms rose Louhi’s people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the spears and swords of Northland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were directed at thy hero;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All of Pohya turned against me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned against a single foeman.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of the mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I had told thee this beforehand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I had warned thee of this danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forbidden thee to journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hostile fields of Northland.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here my hero could have lingered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Passed his life in full contentment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lived forever with his mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his mother for protection,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the court-yard with his kindred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here no war would have arisen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No contention would have followed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither wilt thou go, my hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither will my loved one hasten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To escape thy fierce pursuers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To escape from thy misdoings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From thy sins to hide in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From thy crimes and misdemeanors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy head be not endangered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy body be not mangled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy locks be not outrooted?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Know I not a spot befitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not know a place of safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where to hide from my pursuers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will give me sure protection</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the crimes by me committed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Helpful mother of my being,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where to flee wilt thou advise me?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of the mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I do not know where I can send thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be a pine-tree on the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or a juniper in lowlands?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then misfortune may befall thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often is the mountain pine-tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut in splints for candle-lighters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the juniper is often</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peeled for fence-posts for the pastures.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go a birch-tree to the valleys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or an elm-tree to the glen-wood?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even then may trouble find thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Misery may overtake thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often is the lowland birch-tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut to pieces in the ware-house;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often is the elm-wood forest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cleared away for other plantings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be a berry on the highlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cranberry upon the heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strawberry upon the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blackberry along the fences?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even there will trouble find thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There misfortune overtake thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the berry-maids would pluck thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silver-tinselled girls would get thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be a pike then in the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or a troutlet in the rivers?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then would trouble overtake thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would become thy life-companion;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the fisherman would catch thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Catch thee in his net of flax-thread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Catch thee with his cruel fish-hook.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be a wolf then in the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or a black-bear in the thickets?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even then would trouble find thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And disaster cross thy pathway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sable hunters of the Northland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have their spears and crossbows ready</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To destroy the wolf and black-bear.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Know I well the worst of places,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know where Death will surely follow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where misfortune’s eye would find me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since thou gavest me existence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gavest nourishment in childhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither shall I flee for safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither hide from death and danger?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my view is fell destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dire misfortune hovers o’er me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the morrow come the spearmen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Countless warriors from Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ahti’s head their satisfaction.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of the mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I can name a goodly refuge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Name a land of small dimensions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Name a distant ocean-island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my son may live in safety.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thither archers never wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There thy head cannot be severed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But an oath as strong as heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou must swear before thy mother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wilt not for sixty summers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Join in war or deadly combat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even though thou wishest silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wishest gold and silver treasures.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the grateful Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will swear an oath of honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I’ll not in sixty summers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Draw my sword in the arena,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Test the warrior in battle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have wounds upon my shoulders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On my breast two scars of broadsword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my former battles, relics,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Relics of my last encounters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the battle-fields of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the wars with men and heroes.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Go thou, take thy father’s vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go and hide thyself in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travel far across nine oceans;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the tenth, sail to the centre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the island, forest-covered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cliffs above the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where thy father went before thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where he hid from his pursuers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the times of summer conquests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the darksome days of battle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good the isle for thee to dwell in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goodly place to live and linger;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hide one year, and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the third return in safety</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy mother’s island dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy father’s ancient mansion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my hero’s place of resting.”</span>
