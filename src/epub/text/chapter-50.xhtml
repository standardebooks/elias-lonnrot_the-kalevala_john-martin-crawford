			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>Mariatta, child of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grew to maidenhood in Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the cabin of her father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the chambers of her mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden ringlets, silver girdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worn against the keys paternal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glittering upon her bosom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wore away the father’s threshold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the long robes of her garments;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wore away the painted rafters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her beauteous silken ribbons;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wore away the gilded pillars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the touching of her fingers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wore away the birchen flooring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the tramping of her fur-shoes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mariatta, child of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Magic maid of little stature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guarded well her sacred virtue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her sincerity and honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fed upon the dainty whiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the inner bark of birch-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the tender flesh of lambkins.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When she hastened in the evening</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To her milking in the hurdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake in innocence as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Never will the snow-white virgin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Milk the kine of one unworthy!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When she journeyed over snow-fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the seat beside her father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake in purity as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not behind a steed unworthy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will I ever ride the snow-sledge!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mariatta, child of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lived a virgin with her mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a maiden highly honored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lived in innocence and beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Daily drove her flocks to pasture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walking with the gentle lambkins.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the lambkins climbed the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they gamboled on the hill-tops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stepped the virgin to the meadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skipping through a grove of lindens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the calling of the cuckoo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the songster’s golden measures.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mariatta, child of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked about, intently listened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat upon the berry-meadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat awhile, and meditated</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a hillock by the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soliloquized as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Call to me, thou golden cuckoo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing, thou sacred bird of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing, thou silver breasted songster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak, thou strawberry of Ehstland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell how long must I unmarried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a shepherdess neglected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wander o’er these hills and mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through these flowery fens and fallows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me, cuckoo of the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing to me how many summers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must live without a husband,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a shepherdess neglected!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mariatta, child of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lived a shepherd-maid for ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a virgin with her mother.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wretched are the lives of shepherds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lives of maidens still more wretched,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guarding flocks upon the mountains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Serpents creep in bog and stubble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the greensward dart the lizards;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But it was no serpent singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor a sacred lizard calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was but the mountain-berry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calling to the lonely maiden:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come, O virgin, come and pluck me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come and take me to thy bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take me, tinsel-breasted virgin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take me, maiden, copper-belted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the slimy snail devours me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the black-worm feeds upon me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hundreds pass my way unmindful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thousands come within my hearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Berry-maidens swarm about me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Children come in countless numbers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None of these has come to gather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to pluck this ruddy berry.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mariatta, child of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Listened to its gentle pleading,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran to pick the berry, calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her fair and dainty fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw it smiling near the meadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a cranberry in feature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a strawberry in flavor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the virgin, Mariatta,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could not pluck the woodland-stranger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon she cut a charm-stick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Downward pressed upon the berry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When it rose as if by magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose above her shoes of ermine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then above her copper girdle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Darted upward to her bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaped upon the maiden’s shoulder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her dimpled chin it rested,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her lips it perched a moment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to her tongue expectant;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To and fro it rocked and lingered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence it hastened on its journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Settled in the maiden’s bosom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mariatta, child of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus became a bride impregnate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wedded to the mountain-berry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lingered in her room at morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat at midday in the darkness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to her couch at evening.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the watchful mother wonders:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What has happened to our Mary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To our virgin, Mariatta,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she throws aside her girdle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shyly slips through hall and chamber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lingers in her room at morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens to her couch at evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sits at midday in the darkness?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the floor a babe was playing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the young child thus made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This has happened to our Mary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To our virgin, Mariatta,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This misfortune to the maiden:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She has lingered by the meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Played too long among the lambkins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tasted of the mountain-berry.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Long the virgin watched and waited,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anxiously the days she counted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting for the dawn of trouble.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finally she asked her mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Mariatta:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Faithful mother, fond and tender,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mother whom I love and cherish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make for me a place befitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my troubles may be lessened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my heavy burdens lightened.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of the mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Woe to thee, thou Hisi-maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since thou art a bride unworthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wedded only to dishonor!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mariatta, child of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus replied in truthful measures:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I am not a maid of Hisi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am not a bride unworthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Am not wedded to dishonor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a shepherdess I wandered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the lambkins to the glen-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandered to the berry-mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the strawberry had ripened;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick as thought I plucked the berry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On my tongue I gently laid it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To and fro it rocked and lingered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Settled in my heaving bosom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the source of all my trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only cause of my dishonor!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the mother was relentless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked the maiden of her father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the virgin-mother’s pleading:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O my father, full of pity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Source of both my good and evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Build for me a place befitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my troubles may be lessened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my heavy burdens lightened.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This the answer of the father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the father unforgiving:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Go, thou evil child of Hisi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go, thou child of sin and sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wedded only to dishonor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Great Bear’s rocky chamber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the stone-cave of the growler,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to lessen all thy troubles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to cast thy heavy burdens!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mariatta, child of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus made answer to her father:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I am not a child of Hisi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am not a bride unworthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Am not wedded to dishonor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall bear a noble hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall bear a son immortal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will rule among the mighty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rule the ancient Wainamoinen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the virgin-mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandered hither, wandered thither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeking for a place befitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeking for a worthy birthplace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her unborn son and hero;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finally these words she uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Piltti, thou my youngest maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trustiest of all my servants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seek a place within the village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ask it of the brook of Sara,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the troubled Mariatta,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Child of sorrow and misfortune.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the little maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Piltti, spake these words in answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whom shall I entreat for succor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will lend me his assistance?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Mariatta:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Go and ask it of Ruotus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the reed-brook pours her waters.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the servant, Piltti,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever hopeful, ever willing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to obey her mistress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Needing not her exhortation;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened like the rapid river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the flying smoke of battle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cabin of Ruotus.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she walked the hill-tops tottered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she ran the mountains trembled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shore-reeds danced upon the pasture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sandstones skipped about the heather</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the maiden, Piltti, hastened</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dwelling of Ruotus.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At his table in his cabin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat Ruotus, eating, drinking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his simple coat of linen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his elbows on the table</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the wizard in amazement:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why hast thou, a maid of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to see me in my cavern,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the message thou art bringing?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the servant, Piltti,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave this answer to the wizard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Seek I for a spot befitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seek I for a worthy birthplace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For an unborn child and hero;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seek it near the Sara-streamlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the reed-brook pours her waters.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Came the wife of old Ruotus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walking with her arms akimbo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed the maiden, Piltti:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who is she that asks assistance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who the maiden thus dishonored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What her name, and who her kindred?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I have come for Mariatta,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the worthy virgin-mother.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the wife of old Ruotus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evil-minded, cruel-hearted:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Occupied are all our chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All our bath-rooms near the reed-brook;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mount of fire are couches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is a stable in the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the flaming horse of Hisi;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the stable is a manger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fitting birthplace for the hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the wife of cold misfortune,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worthy couch for Mariatta!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the servant, Piltti,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to her anxious mistress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these measures, much regretting.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There is not a place befitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the silver brook of Sara.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the wife of old Ruotus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Occupied are all the chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the bath-rooms near the reed-brook;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mount of fire are couches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is a stable in the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the flaming horse of Hisi;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the stable is a manger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fitting birthplace for the hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the wife of cold misfortune,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worthy couch for Mariatta.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the hapless maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mariatta, virgin-mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell to bitter tears and murmurs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in depths of sorrow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I, alas! must go an outcast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wander as a wretched hireling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a servant in dishonor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hasten to the burning mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the stable in the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make my bed within a manger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the flaming steed of Hisi!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick the hapless virgin-mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Outcast from her father’s dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathered up her flowing raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grasped a broom of birchen branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened forth in pain and sorrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the stable in the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the heights of Tapio’s mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in supplication:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come, I pray thee, my Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only friend in times of trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to me and bring protection</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy child, the virgin-mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the maiden, Mariatta,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this hour of sore affliction.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to me, benignant Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, thou only hope and refuge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest thy guiltless child should perish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Die the death of the unworthy!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the virgin, Mariatta,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had arrived within the stable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the flaming horse of Hisi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She addressed the steed as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Breathe, O sympathizing fire-horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathe on me, the virgin-mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let thy heated breath give moisture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let thy pleasant warmth surround me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the vapor of the morning;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let this pure and helpless maiden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Find a refuge in thy manger!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the horse, in pity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathed the moisture of his nostrils</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the body of the virgin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrapped her in a cloud of vapor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave her warmth and needed comforts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave his aid to the afflicted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the virgin, Mariatta.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There the babe was born and cradled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cradled in a woodland-manger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the virgin, Mariatta,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pure as pearly dews of morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Holy as the stars in heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the mother rocks her infant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his swaddling clothes she wraps him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lays him in her robes of linen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carefully the babe she nurtures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well she guards her much-beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guards her golden child of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her beloved gem of silver.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But alas! the child has vanished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vanished while the mother slumbered.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mariatta, lone and wretched,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell to weeping, broken-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened off to seek her infant.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everywhere the mother sought him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought her golden child of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her beloved gem of silver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought him underneath the millstone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sledge she sought him vainly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Underneath the sieve she sought him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Underneath the willow-basket,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touched the trees, the grass she parted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long she sought her golden infant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought him on the fir-tree-mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the vale, and hill, and heather;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looks within the clumps of flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well examines every thicket,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifts the juniper and willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifts the branches of the alder.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lo! a star has come to meet her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the star she thus beseeches:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O, thou guiding-star of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Star of hope, by God created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou know and wilt thou tell me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my darling child has wandered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my holy babe lies hidden?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the star of Northland answers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If I knew, I would not tell thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis thy child that me created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set me here to watch at evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the cold to shine forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here to twinkle in the darkness.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Comes the golden Moon to meet her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Moon she thus beseeches:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Golden Moon, by Ukko fashioned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hope and joy of Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou know and wilt thou tell me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my darling child has wandered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my holy babe lies hidden?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks the golden Moon in answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If I knew I would not tell thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis thy child that me created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here to wander in the darkness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All alone at eve to wander</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On my cold and cheerless journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleeping only in the daylight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shining for the good of others.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the virgin-mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls again to bitter weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens on through fen and forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeking for her babe departed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Comes the silver Sun to meet her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Sun she thus addresses:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Silver Sun by Ukko fashioned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Source of light and life to Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou know and wilt thou tell me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my darling child has wandered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my holy babe lies hidden?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wisely does the Sun make answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Well I know thy babe’s dominions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where thy holy child is sleeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Wainola’s light lies hidden;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis thy child that me created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made me king of earth and ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the Moon and Stars attend me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set me here to shine at midday,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes me shine in silver raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lets me sleep and rest at evening;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yonder is thy golden infant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There thy holy babe lies sleeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hidden to his belt in water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hidden in the reeds and rushes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mariatta, child of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Virgin-mother of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway seeks her babe in Swamp-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds him in the reeds and rushes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the young child on her bosom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dwelling of her father.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There the infant grew in beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathered strength, and light, and wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All of Suomi saw and wondered.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one knew what name to give him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the mother named him, Flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Others named him, Son-of-Sorrow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the virgin, Mariatta,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought the priesthood to baptize him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came an old man, Wirokannas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a cup of holy water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bringing to the babe his blessing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the gray-beard spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I shall not baptize a wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not bless a black-magician</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the drops of holy water;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the young child be examined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us know that he is worthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest he prove the son of witchcraft.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon old Wirokannas</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called the ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal wisdom-singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To inspect the infant-wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To report him good or evil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carefully the child examined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave this answer to his people:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Since the child is but an outcast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Born and cradled in a manger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since the berry is his father;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let him lie upon the heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let him sleep among the rushes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let him live upon the mountains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take the young child to the marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dash his head against the birch-tree.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the child of Mariatta,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only two weeks old, made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O, thou ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Son of Folly and Injustice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Senseless hero of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falsely hast thou rendered judgment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy years, for greater follies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Greater sins and misdemeanors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wert not unjustly punished.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy former years of trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thou gavest thine own brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thy selfish life a ransom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to save thee from destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then thou wert not sent to Swamp-land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be murdered for thy follies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy former years of sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the beauteous Aino perished</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the deep and boundless blue-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To escape thy persecutions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then thou wert not evil-treated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wert not banished by thy people.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon old Wirokannas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the wilderness the ruler,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touched the child with holy water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave the wonder-babe his blessing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave him rights of royal heirship,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Free to live and grow a hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To become a mighty ruler,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King and Master of Karyala.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>As the years passed Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Recognized his waning powers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang his farewell song to Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the people of Wainola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang himself a boat of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful his bark of magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the helm sat the magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat the ancient wisdom-singer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Westward, westward, sailed the hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the blue-back of the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing as he left Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This his plaintive song and echo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Suns may rise and set in Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise and set for generations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the North will learn my teachings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will recall my wisdom-sayings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hungry for the true religion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will Suomi need my coming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Watch for me at dawn of morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I may bring back the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring anew the harp of joyance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring again the golden moonlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring again the silver sunshine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peace and plenty to the Northland.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus the ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his copper-banded vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left his tribe in Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing o’er the rolling billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing through the azure vapors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing through the dusk of evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing to the fiery sunset,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the higher-landed regions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the lower verge of heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly gained the far horizon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gained the purple-colored harbor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There his bark he firmly anchored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rested in his boat of copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he left his harp of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left his songs and wisdom-sayings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the lasting joy of Suomi.</span>
