			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, the magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes his steed of copper color,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hitches quick his fleet-foot courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Puts his racer to the snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway springs upon the cross-seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snaps his whip adorned with jewels.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the winds the steed flies onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a lightning flash, the racer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes the snow-sledge creak and rattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes the highway quickly vanish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dashes on through fen and forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over hills and through the valleys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over marshes, over mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over fertile plains and meadows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Journeys one day, then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So a third from morn till evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the third day evening brings him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the endless bridge of Osmo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Osmo-fields and pastures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the plains of Kalevala;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the hero spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“May the wolves devour the dreamer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eat the Laplander for dinner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May disease destroy the braggart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him who said that I should never</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See again my much-loved home-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nevermore behold my kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never during all my lifetime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never while the sunshine brightens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never while the moonlight glimmers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the meadows of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the plains of Kalevala.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then began old Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient bard and famous singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To renew his incantations;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang aloft a wondrous pine-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till it pierced the clouds in growing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its golden top and branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till it touched the very heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread its branches in the ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the ever-shining sunlight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now he sings again enchanting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings the Moon to shine forever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the fir-tree’s emerald branches;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In its top he sings the Great Bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he quickly journeys homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens to his golden portals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Head awry and visage wrinkled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crooked cap upon his forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since as ransom he had promised</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen, magic artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to save his life from torture</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the distant fields of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dismal Sariola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When his stallion he had halted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the Osmo-field and meadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly rising in his snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The magician heard one knocking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaking coal within the smithy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beating with a heavy hammer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen, famous minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Entering the smithy straightway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knocking with his copper hammer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Welcome, brother Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old and worthy Wainamoinen!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why so long hast thou been absent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where hast thou so long been hiding?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen then made answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of the magician:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Long indeed have I been living,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many dreary days have wandered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many cheerless nights have lingered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Floating on the cruel ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeping in the fens and woodlands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the never-pleasant Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dismal Sariola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the Laplanders I’ve wandered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the people filled with witchcraft.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Promptly answers Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words the blacksmith uses:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Famous and eternal singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me of thy journey northward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of thy wanderings in Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of thy dismal journey homeward.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the minstrel, Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have much to tell thee, brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Listen to my wondrous story:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Northland lives a virgin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a village there, a maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will not accept a lover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That a hero’s hand refuses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That a wizard’s heart disdaineth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All of Northland sings her praises,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings her worth and magic beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest maiden of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Daughter of the earth and ocean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From her temples beams the moonlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From her breast, the gleam of sunshine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From her forehead shines the rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her neck, the seven starlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Great Bear from her shoulder.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ilmarinen, worthy brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou the only skilful blacksmith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go and see her wondrous beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See her gold and silver garments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See her robed in finest raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See her sitting on the rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walking on the clouds of purple.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge for her the magic Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge the lid in many colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy reward shall be the virgin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt win this bride of beauty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go and bring the lovely maiden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy home in Kalevala.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the brother, Ilmarinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou cunning Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast promised me already</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the ever-darksome Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy devoted head to ransom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to rescue thee from trouble.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall never visit Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not go to see thy maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not love the Bride of Beauty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never while the moonlight glimmers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall I go to dreary Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the plains of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the people eat each other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sink their heroes in the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not for all the maids of Lapland.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the brother, Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I can tell thee greater wonders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Listen to my wondrous story:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have seen the fir-tree blossom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seen its flowers with emerald branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the Osmo-fields and woodlands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In its top, there shines the moonlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Bear lives in its branches.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen thus made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I cannot believe thy story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot trust thy tale of wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till I see the blooming fir-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its many emerald branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its Bear and golden moonlight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is Wainamoinen’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wilt thou not believe my story?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come with me and I will show thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If my lips speak fact or fiction.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick they journey to discover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haste to view the wondrous fir-tree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen leads the journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen closely follows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As they near the Osmo-borders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen hastens forward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he may behold the wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spies the Bear within the fir-top,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting on its emerald branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spies the gleam of golden moonlight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words the singer uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Climb this tree, dear Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bring down the golden moonbeams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring the Moon and Bear down with thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fir-tree’s lofty branches.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen, full consenting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway climbed the golden fir-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High upon the bow of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence to bring the golden moonbeams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence to bring the Bear of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fir-tree’s topmost branches.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the blooming fir-tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words to Ilmarinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou senseless, thoughtless hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast neither wit nor instinct;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou dost climb my golden branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a thing of little judgment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to get my pictured moonbeams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take away my silver starlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steal my Bear and blooming branches.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick as thought old Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang again in magic accents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang a storm-wind in the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the wild winds into fury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the singer spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Take, O storm-wind, take the forgeman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carry him within thy vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly hence, and land the hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the ever-darksome Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the dismal Sariola.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the storm-wind quickly darkens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly piles the air together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes of air a sailing vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fleetly from the fir-tree branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the never-pleasant Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the dismal Sariola.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the air sailed Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fast and far the hero travelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweeping onward, sailing northward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Riding in the track of storm-winds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the Moon, beneath the sunshine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the broad back of the Great Bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he neared Pohyola’s woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neared the homes of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And alighted undiscovered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not noticed by the hunters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not scented by the watch-dogs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient, toothless dame of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Standing in the open court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addresses Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As she spies the hero-stranger:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who art thou of ancient heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who of all the host of heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coming here upon the storm-wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the sledge-path of the ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scented not by Pohya’s watch-dogs?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is Ilmarinen’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have surely not come hither</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be barked at by the watch-dogs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At these unfamiliar portals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the gates of Sariola.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the Northland hostess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asks again the hero-stranger:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hast thou ever been acquainted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the blacksmith of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the hero, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the skilful smith and artist?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long I’ve waited for his coming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long this one has been expected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the borders of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here to forge for me the Sampo.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hero, Ilmarinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Well indeed am I acquainted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I myself am Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, the skilful smith and artist.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toothless dame of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway rushes to her dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words that Louhi utters:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come, thou youngest of my daughters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, thou fairest of my maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dress thyself in finest raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deck thy hair with rarest jewels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pearls upon thy swelling bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On thy neck, a golden necklace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bind thy head with silken ribbons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make thy cheeks look fresh and ruddy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thy visage fair and winsome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since the artist, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither comes from Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here to forge for us the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hammer us the lid in colors.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the daughter of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Honored by the land and water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway takes her choicest raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes her dresses rich in beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finest of her silken wardrobe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now adjusts her silken fillet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her brow a band of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round her waist a golden girdle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round her neck a pearly necklace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shining gold upon her bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her hair the threads of silver.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From her dressing-room she hastens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hall she hastes and listens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of beauty, full of joyance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ears erect and eyes bright-beaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ruddy cheeks and charming visage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting for the hero-stranger.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leads the hero, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To her dwelling-rooms in Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To her home in Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seats him at her well-filled table,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives to him the finest viands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives him every needed comfort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then addresses him as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Master of the forge and smithy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Canst thou forge for me the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hammer me the lid in colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the tips of white-swan feathers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the milk of greatest virtue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From a single grain of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the finest wool of lambkins?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt have my fairest daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Recompense for this thy service.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Ilmarinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will forge for thee the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hammer thee the lid in colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the tips of white-swan feathers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the milk of greatest virtue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From a single grain of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the finest wool of lambkins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since I forged the arch of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forged the air a concave cover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the earth had a beginning.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the magic blacksmith</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went to forge the wondrous Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went to find a blacksmith’s workshop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went to find the tools to work with;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he found no place for forging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found no smithy, found no bellows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found no chimney, found no anvil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found no tongs, and found no hammer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the artist, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words, soliloquizing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Only women grow discouraged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only knaves leave work unfinished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the devils, nor the heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the Gods of greater knowledge.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought a place to build a smithy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought a place to plant a bellows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the borders of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the Pohya-hills and meadows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Searched one day, and then a second;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the evening of the third day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came a rock within his vision,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came a stone with rainbow-colors.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set at work to build his smithy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built a fire and raised a chimney;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the next day laid his bellows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the third day built his furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And began to forge the Sampo.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The eternal magic artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First of all the iron-workers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mixed together certain metals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put the mixture in the cauldron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid it deep within the furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called the hirelings to the forging.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skilfully they work the bellows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tend the fire and add the fuel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three most lovely days of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three short nights of bright midsummer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the rocks begin to blossom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the foot-prints of the workmen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the magic heat and furnace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the first day, Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Downward bent and well examined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the bottom of his furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to see what might be forming</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the magic fire and metals.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fire arose a crossbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the brightness of the moonbeams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden bow with tips of silver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the shaft was shining copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the bow was strong and wondrous,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But alas! it was ill-natured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asking for a hero daily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two the heads it asked on feast-days.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen, skilful artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not pleased with this creation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broke the bow in many pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threw them back within the furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kept the workmen at the bellows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tried to forge the magic Sampo.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the second day, the blacksmith</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Downward bent and well examined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the bottom of the furnace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fire, a skiff of metals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came a boat of purple color,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the ribs were colored golden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the oars were forged from copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the skiff was full of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But alas! a thing of evil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forth it rushes into trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens into every quarrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastes without a provocation</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into every evil combat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen, metal artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is not pleased with this creation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks the skiff in many fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throws them back within the furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keeps the workmen at the bellows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to forge the magic Sampo.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the third day, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First of all the metal-workers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Downward bent and well examined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the bottom of the furnace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There he saw a heifer rising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden were the horns of Kimmo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her head the Bear of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her brow a disc of sunshine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful the cow of magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But alas! she is ill-tempered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rushes headlong through the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rushes through the swamps and meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wasting all her milk in running.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen, the magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is not pleased with this creation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cuts the magic cow in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throws them in the fiery furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sets the workmen at the bellows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to forge the magic Sampo.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the fourth day, Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Downward bent and well examined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bottom of the furnace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There beheld a plow in beauty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rising from the fire of metals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden was the point and plowshare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the beam was forged from copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the handles, molten silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful the plow and wondrous;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But alas! it is ill-mannered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plows up fields of corn and barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Furrows through the richest meadows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen, metal artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is not pleased with this creation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly breaks the plow in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throws them back within the furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lets the winds attend the bellows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lets the storm-winds fire the metals.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fiercely vie the winds of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>East-wind rushing, West-wind roaring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>South-wind crying, North-wind howling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blow one day and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blow the third from morn till even,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the fire leaps through the windows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the door the sparks fly upward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clouds of smoke arise to heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the clouds the black smoke mingles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the storm-winds ply the bellows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the third night Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bending low to view his metals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the bottom of the furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees the magic Sampo rising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees the lid in many colors.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the artist of Wainola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forges with the tongs and anvil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knocking with a heavy hammer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forges skilfully the Sampo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On one side the flour is grinding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On another salt is making,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a third is money forging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the lid is many-colored.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well the Sampo grinds when finished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To and fro the lid in rocking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grinds one measure at the day-break,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grinds a measure fit for eating,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grinds a second for the market,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grinds a third one for the storehouse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Joyfully the dame of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes away the magic Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hills of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the copper-bearing mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Puts nine locks upon the wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes three strong roots creep around it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the earth they grow nine fathoms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One large root beneath the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One beneath the sandy sea-bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One beneath the mountain-dwelling.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Modestly pleads Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the maiden’s willing answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of the magician:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wilt thou come with me, fair maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be my wife and queen forever?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have forged for thee the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forged the lid in many colors.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Northland’s fair and lovely daughter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answers thus the metal-worker:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who will in the coming spring-time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will in the second summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guide the cuckoo’s song and echo?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will listen to his calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will sing with him in autumn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should I go to distant regions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should this cheery maiden vanish</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fields of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Pohyola’s fens and forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the cuckoo sings and echoes?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should I leave my father’s dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should my mother’s berry vanish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should these mountains lose their cherry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the cuckoo too would vanish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the birds would leave the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave the summit of the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave my native fields and woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never shall I, in my lifetime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Say farewell to maiden freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor to summer cares and labors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest the harvest be ungarnered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest the berries be ungathered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest the song-birds leave the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest the mermaids leave the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest I sing with them no longer.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen, the magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal metal-forger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cap awry and head dejected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disappointed, heavy-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Empty-handed, well considers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to reach his distant country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reach his much-loved home and kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gain the meadows of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the never-pleasant Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the darksome Sariola.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Louhi thus addressed the suitor:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why art thou so heavy-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why thy visage so dejected?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast thou in thy mind to journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the vales and hills of Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the meadows of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy home in Kalevala?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is Ilmarinen’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thitherward my mind is tending,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my home-land let me journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my kindred let me linger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be at rest in mine own country.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Straightway Louhi, dame of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave the hero every comfort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave him food and rarest viands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Placed him in a boat of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a copper-banded vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called the winds to his assistance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the North-wind guide him homeward.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the skilful Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travels toward his native country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue back of the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travels one day, then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the third day evening brings him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Wainola’s peaceful meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his home in Kalevala.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Straightway ancient Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addresses Ilmarinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O my brother, metal-artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou eternal wonder-worker,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Didst thou forge the magic Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge the lid in many colors?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the brother, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words the master uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, I forged the magic Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forged the lid in many colors;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To and fro the lid in rocking</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grinds one measure at the day-dawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grinds a measure fit for eating,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grinds a second for the market,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grinds a third one for the storehouse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Louhi has the wondrous Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have not the Bride of Beauty.”</span>
