			<p>
				<span>Kullerwoinen, young magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his beauteous, golden ringlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his magic shoes of deer-skin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left the home of Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandered forth upon his journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the blacksmith heard the tidings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the cruel death and torture</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his wife and joy-companion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest a bloody fight should follow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kullerwoinen left the smithy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blowing on his magic bugle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joyful left the lands of Ilma,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blowing blithely on the heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the distant hills re-echo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the swamps and mountains tremble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the heather-blossoms answer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the music of his cow-horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In its wild reverberations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the magic of his playing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Songs were heard within the smithy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the blacksmith stopped and listened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to the door and window,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to the open court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If perchance he might discover</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What was playing on the heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What was sounding through the forest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick he learned the cruel story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Learned the cause of the rejoicing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the hostess dead before him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knew his beauteous wife had perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the lifeless form extended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the court-yard of his dwelling.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon the metal-artist</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell to bitter tears and wailings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept through all the dreary night-time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep the grief that settled o’er him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Black as night his darkened future,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could not stay his tears of sorrow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kullerwoinen hastened onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straying, roaming, hither, thither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandered on through field and forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the Hisi-plains and woodlands.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the darkness settled o’er him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the bird of night was flitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat the fatherless at evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The forsaken sat and rested</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a hillock of the forest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus he murmured, heavy-hearted:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why was I, alas! created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why was I so ill-begotten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since for months and years I wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lost among the ether-spaces?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Others have their homes to dwell in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Others hasten to their firesides</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the evening gathers round them:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But my home is in the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my bed upon the heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my bath-room is the rain-cloud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Never didst thou, God of mercy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never in the course of ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give an infant birth unwisely;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherefore then was I created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fatherless to roam in ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Motherless and lone to wander?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou, O Ukko, art my father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast given me form and feature;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the sea-gull on the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the duck upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shines the Sun upon the swallow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shines as bright upon the sparrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives the joy-birds song and gladness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not shine on me unhappy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nevermore will shine the sunlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never will the moonlight glimmer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this hapless son and orphan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not know my hero-father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot tell who was my mother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the shore, perhaps the gray-duck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left me in the sand to perish.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young was I and small of stature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When my mother left me orphaned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dead, my father and my mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dead, my honored tribe of heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shoes they left me that are icy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stockings filled with frosts of ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me on the freezing ice-plains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall to perish in the rushes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the giddy heights of mountains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me tumble to destruction.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O, thou wise and good Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why my birth and what my service?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall never fall and perish</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the ice-plains, in the marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never be a bridge in swamp-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not while I have arms of virtue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can serve my honored kindred!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Kullervo thought to journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the village of Untamo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To avenge his father’s murder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To avenge his mother’s tortures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the troubles of his tribe-folk.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Kullerwoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wait, yea wait, thou Untamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou destroyer of my people;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I meet thee in the combat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will slay thee and thy kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will burn thy homes to ashes!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Came a woman on the highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dressed in blue, the aged mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Kullervo spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whither goest, Kullerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither hastes the wayward hero?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen gave this answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have thought that I would journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the far-off land of strangers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the village of Untamo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To avenge my father’s murder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To avenge my mother’s tortures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the troubles of my tribe-folk.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the gray-haired woman answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Surely thou dost rest in error,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thy tribe has never perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thy mother still is living</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thy father in the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Living with the old Kalervo.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O, thou ancient dame beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worthy mother of the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me where my father liveth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my loving mother lingers!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yonder lives thine aged father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thy loving mother with him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the farthest shore of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the long-point of the fish-lake!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Tell me, O thou woodland-mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to journey to my people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to find mine honored tribe-folk.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Easy is the way for strangers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou must journey through the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hasten to the river-border,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travel one day, then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the third from morn till even,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the north-west, thou must journey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If a mountain comes to meet thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go around the nearing mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Westward hold thy weary journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till thou comest to a river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On thy right hand flowing eastward;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travel to the river border,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where three waterfalls will greet thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thou comest to a headland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the point thou’lt see a cottage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the fishermen assemble;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this cottage is thy father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thy mother and her daughters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful thy maiden sisters.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kullerwoinen, the magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens northward on his journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walks one day, and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walks the third from morn till evening;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the north-west walks Kullervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till a mountain comes to meet him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walks around the nearing mountain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Westward, westward, holds his journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he sees a river coming;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens to the river border,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walks along the streams and rapids</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till three waterfalls accost him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travels till he meets a headland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the point he spies a cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the fishermen assemble.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick he journeys to the cabin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick he passes through the portals</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the cottage on the headland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where he finds his long-lost kindred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one knows the youth, Kullervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one knows whence comes the stranger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where his home, nor where he goeth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of young Kullervo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Dost thou know me not, my mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou know me not, my father?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am hapless Kullerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom the heroes of Untamo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carried to their distant country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When my height was but a hand-breadth.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the hopeful mother answers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O my worthy son, beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O my precious silver-buckle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast thou with thy mind of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandered through the fields of Northland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Searching for thy home and kindred?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As one dead I long have mourned thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had supposed thee in Manala.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once I had two sons and heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had two good and beauteous daughters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two of these have long been absent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elder son and elder daughter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the wars my son departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While my daughter strayed and perished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If my son is home returning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet my daughter still is absent.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen asked his mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whither did my sister wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What direction did she journey?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of the mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This the story of thy sister:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went for berries to the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the mountains went my daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the lovely maiden vanished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my pretty berry perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Died some death beyond my knowledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nameless is the death she suffered.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who is mourning for the daughter?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one mourns her as her mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walks and wanders, mourns and searches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her fairest child and daughter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore did the mother wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Searching for thy lovely sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the bear she roamed the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran the glenways like the adder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Searched one day and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Searched the third from morn till even,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till she reached the mountain-summit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There she called and called her daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the distant mountains answered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called to her who had departed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Where art thou, my lovely maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come my daughter to thy mother!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thus I called, and sought thy sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the hills and valleys echoed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Call no more, thou weeping mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep no more for the departed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nevermore in all thy lifetime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never in the course of ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will she join again her kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At her brother’s landing-places,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her father’s humble dwelling.’ ”</span>
