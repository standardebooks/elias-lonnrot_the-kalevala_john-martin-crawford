			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen, full of joyance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took provisions in abundance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fish and butter, bread and bacon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to the Isle of Refuge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailed away across the oceans,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these measures on departing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fare thee well, mine Island-dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must sail to other borders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To an island more protective,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the second summer passes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the serpents keep the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lynxes rest within the glen-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the blue-moose roam the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the wild-geese cat the barley.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fare thee well, my helpful mother!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the warriors of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the dismal Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come with swords, and spears, and cross-bows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asking for my head in vengeance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Say that I have long departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left my mother’s Island-dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the barley had been garnered.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he launched his boat of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threw the vessel to the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the iron-banded rollers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the cylinders of oak-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the masts the sails he hoisted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread the magic sails of linen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the stern the hero settled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And prepared to sail his vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One hand resting on the rudder.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the sailor spake as follows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Blow, ye winds, and drive me onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blow ye steady, winds of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the island in the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That my bark may fly in safety</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my father’s place of refuge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the far and nameless island!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon the winds arose as bidden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocked the vessel o’er the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the blue-back of the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the vast expanse of ocean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blew two months and blew unceasing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blew a third month toward the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward his father’s Isle of Refuge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat some maidens on the seaside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the sandy beach of ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned about in all directions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looking out upon the billows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One was waiting for her brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a second for her father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a third one, anxious, waited</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the coming of her suitor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There they spied young Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There perceived the hero’s vessel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing o’er the bounding billows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was like a hanging cloudlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hanging twixt the earth and heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the island-maidens wondered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus they spake to one another:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What this stranger on the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What is this upon the waters?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art thou one of our sea-vessels?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wert thou builded on this island?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sail thou straightway to the harbor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the island-point of landing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy tribe may be discovered.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Onward did the waves propel it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocked his vessel o’er the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drove it to the magic island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Safely landed Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the sandy shore and harbor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake he thus when he had landed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words that Ahti uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is there room upon this island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is there space within this harbor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my bark may lie at anchor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the sun may dry my vessel?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of the virgins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dwellers on the Isle of Refuge:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There is room within this harbor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this island, space abundant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where thy bark may lie at anchor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the sun may dry thy vessel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lying ready are the rollers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cylinders adorned with copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou hadst a hundred vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou come with boats a thousand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We would give them room in welcome.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolled his vessel in the harbor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the cylinders of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words when he had ended:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is there room upon this island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or a spot within these forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where a hero may be hidden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the coming din of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the play of spears and arrows?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus replied the Island-maidens:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There are places on this island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On these plains a spot befitting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where to hide thyself in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hero-son of little valor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here are many, many castles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many courts upon this island;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though there come a thousand heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though a thousand spearmen follow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst hide thyself in safety.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is there room upon this island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the birch-tree grows abundant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where this son may fell the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And may cultivate the fallow?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answered thus the Island-maidens:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There is not a spot befitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a place upon the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where to rest thy wearied members,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the smallest patch of birch-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst bring to cultivation.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All our fields have been divided,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All these woods have been apportioned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fields and forests have their owners.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen asked this question,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Kaukomieli:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is there room upon this island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worthy spot in field or forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where to Sing my songs of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chant my gathered store of wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing mine ancient songs and legends?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answered thus the Island-maidens:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There is room upon this island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worthy place in these dominions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst sing thy garnered wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst chant thine ancient legends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Legends of the times primeval,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the forest, in the castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the island-plains and pastures.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then began the reckless minstrel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To intone his wizard-sayings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang he alders to the waysides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the oaks upon the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the oak-trees sang be branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On each branch he sang an acorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the acorns, golden rollers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On each roller, sang a cuckoo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then began the cuckoos, calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gold from every throat came streaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Copper fell from every feather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each wing emitted silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled the isle with precious metals.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang again young Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conjured on, and sang, and chanted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang to precious stones the sea-sands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the stones to pearls resplendent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Robed the groves in iridescence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the island full of flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many-colored as the rainbow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang again the magic minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the court a well he conjured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the well a golden cover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the lid a silver dipper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the boys might drink the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the maids might lave their eyelids.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the plains he conjured lakelets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the duck upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden-cheeked and silver-headed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the feet from shining copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Island-maidens wondered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood entranced at Ahti’s wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the songs of Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the hero’s magic power.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the singer, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I would sing a wondrous legend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing in miracles of sweetness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If within some hall or chamber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I were seated at the table.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I sing not in the castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In some spot by walls surrounded</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I sing my songs to zephyrs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fling them to the fields and forests.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answered thus the Island-maidens:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“On this isle are castle-chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Halls for use of magic singers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Courts complete for chanting legends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where thy singing will be welcome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where thy songs will not be scattered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the forests of the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor thy wisdom lost in ether.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway Lemminkainen journeyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the maidens to the castle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There he sang and conjured pitchers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the borders of the tables,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang and conjured golden goblets</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foaming with the beer of barley;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang he many well-filled vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bowls of honey-drink abundant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweetest butter, toothsome biscuit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bacon, fish, and veal, and venison,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the dainties of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewithal to still his hunger.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the proud-heart, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not ready for the banquet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not yet begin his feasting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waited for a knife of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For a knife of golden handle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick he sang the precious metals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang a blade from purest silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the blade a golden handle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway then began his feasting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quenched his thirst and stilled his hunger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charmed the maidens on the island.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the minstrel, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roamed throughout the island-hamlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the joy of all the virgins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the maids of braided tresses;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wheresoe’er he turned his footsteps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There appeared a maid to greet him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When his hand was kindly offered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There his band was kindly taken;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he wandered out at evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even in the darksome places,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the maidens bade him welcome;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was not an island-village</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where there were not seven castles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In each castle seven daughters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the daughters stood in waiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave the hero joyful greetings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only one of all the maidens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom he did not greet with pleasure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the merry Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spent three summers in the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spent a merry time in refuge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hamlets on the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the pleasure of the maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the joy of all the daughters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only one was left neglected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She a poor and graceless spinster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the isle’s remotest border,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the smallest of the hamlets.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Then he thought about his journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the ocean to his mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cottage of his father.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There appeared the slighted spinster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Northland son departing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words to Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O, thou handsome Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wisdom-bard, and magic singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since this maiden thou hast slighted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May the winds destroy thy vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dash thy bark to countless fragments</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the ocean-rocks and ledges!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s thoughts were homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not heed the maiden’s murmurs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not rise before the dawning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the morning on the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the pleasure of the maiden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the much-neglected hamlet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finally at close of evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He resolved to leave the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He resolved to waken early,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long before the dawn of morning;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long before the time appointed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He arose that he might wander</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the hamlets of the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bid adieu to all the maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the morn of his departure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he wandered hither, thither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walking through the village path-ways</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the last of all the hamlets;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw he none of all the castles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where three dwellings were not standing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw he none of all the dwellings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where three heroes were not watching;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw he none of all the heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who was not engaged in grinding</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swords, and spears, and battle-axes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the death of Lemminkainen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these words the hero uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now alas! the Sun arises</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his couch within the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the frailest of the heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the saddest child of Northland;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On my neck the cloak of Lempo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might protect me from all evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though a hundred foes assail me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though a thousand archers follow.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he left the maids ungreeted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left his longing for the daughters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the nameless Isle of Refuge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his farewell-words unspoken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened toward the island-harbor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward his magic bark at anchor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he found it burned to ashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet revenge had fired his vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lighted by the slighted spinster.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he saw the dawn of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw misfortune hanging over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw destruction round about him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway he began rebuilding</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him a magic sailing-vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New and wondrous, full of beauty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the hero needed timber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boards, and planks, and beams, and braces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found the smallest bit of lumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found of boards but seven fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a spool he found three pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found six pieces of the distaff;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With these fragments builds his vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Builds a ship of magic virtue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Builds the bark with secret knowledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the will of the magician;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes one blow, and builds the first part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes a second, builds the centre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes a third with wondrous power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the vessel is completed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon the ship he launches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings the vessel to the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these words the hero utters:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Like a bubble swim these waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a flower ride the billows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loan me of thy magic feathers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three, O eagle, four, O raven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For protection to my vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest it flounder in the ocean!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the sailor, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seats himself upon the bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the vessel he has builded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens on his journey homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Head depressed and evil-humored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cap awry upon his forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mind dejected, heavy-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he could not dwell forever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the castles of the daughters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the nameless Isle of Refuge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the minstrel, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Leave I must this merry island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave her many joys and pleasures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave her maids with braided tresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave her dances and her daughters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the joys of other heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I take this comfort with me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the maidens on the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save the spinster who was slighted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will bemoan my loss for ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will regret my quick departure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They will miss me at the dances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the halls of mirth and joyance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the homes of merry maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On my father’s Isle of Refuge.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept the maidens on the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long lamenting, loudly calling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hero sailing homeward:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whither goest, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why depart, thou best of heroes?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou leave from inattention,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is there here a dearth of maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have our greetings been unworthy?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the magic Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the maids as he was sailing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This in answer to their calling:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Leaving not for want of pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not go from dearth of women</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful the island-maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Countless as the sands their virtues.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the reason of my going,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am longing for my home-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Longing for my mother’s cabins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the strawberries of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the raspberries of Kalew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the maidens of my childhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the children of my mother.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the merry Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bade farewell to all the island;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Winds arose and drove his vessel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue-back of the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the far-extending waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the island of his mother.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the shore were grouped the daughters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the magic Isle of Refuge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the rocks sat the forsaken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeping stood the island-maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden daughters, loud-lamenting.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep the maidens of the island</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the sail-yards greet their vision,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the copper-beltings glisten;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not weep to lose the sail-yards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor to lose the copper-beltings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep they for the loss of Ahti,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the fleeing Kaukomieli</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guiding the departing vessel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Also weeps young Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sorely weeps, and loud-lamenting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeps while he can see the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the island hill-tops glisten;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not mourn the island-mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeps he only for the maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left upon the Isle of Refuge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon sailed Kaukomieli</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue-back of the ocean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailed one day, and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, alas! upon the third day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There arose a mighty storm-wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sky was black with fury.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blew the black winds from the north-west,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the south-east came the whirlwind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tore away the ship’s forecastle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tore away the vessel’s rudder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dashed the wooden hull to pieces.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Headlong fell upon the waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his head he did the steering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his hands and feet, the rowing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swam whole days and nights unceasing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swam with hope and strength united,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till at last appeared a cloudlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Growing cloudlet to the westward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Changing to a promontory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into land within the ocean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swiftly to the shore swam Ahti,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to a magic castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found therein a hostess baking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And her daughters kneading barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these words the hero uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O, thou hostess, filled with kindness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Couldst thou know my pangs of hunger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Couldst thou guess my name and station,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wouldst hasten to the storehouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me beer and foaming liquor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring the best of thy provisions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me fish, and veal, and bacon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Butter, bread, and honeyed biscuits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set for me a wholesome dinner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewithal to still my hunger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quench the thirst of Lemminkainen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Days and nights have I been swimming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Buffeting the waves of ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seemed as if the wind protected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the billows gave me shelter,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the hostess, filled with kindness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to the mountain storehouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut some butter, veal, and bacon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bread, and fish, and honeyed biscuit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought the best of her provisions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought the mead and beer of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set for him a toothsome dinner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewithal to still his hunger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quench the thirst of Lemminkainen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the hero’s feast had ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway was a magic vessel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Given by the kindly hostess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the weary Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bark of beauty, new and hardy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewithal to aid the stranger</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his journey to his home-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cottage of his mother.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly sailed wild Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue-back of the ocean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailed he days and nights unceasing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till at last he reached the borders</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his own loved home and country;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There beheld he scenes familiar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the islands, capes, and rivers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw his former shipping-stations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw he many ancient landmarks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the mountains with their fir-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the pine-trees on the hill-tops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the willows in the lowlands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not see his father’s cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the dwellings of his mother.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where a mansion once had risen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the alder-trees were growing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shrubs were growing on the homestead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Junipers within the court-yard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“In this glen I played and wandered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On these stones I rocked for ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this lawn I rolled and tumbled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frolicked on these woodland-borders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a child of little stature.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where then is my mother’s dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the castles of my father?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire, I fear, has found the hamlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the winds dispersed the ashes.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he fell to bitter weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept one day and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept the third day without ceasing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not mourn the ancient homestead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the dwellings of his father;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept he for his darling mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept he for the dear departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the loved ones of the island.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he saw the bird of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw an eagle flying near him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he asked the bird this question:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mighty eagle, bird majestic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant to me the information,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my mother may have wandered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither I may go and find her!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the eagle knew but little,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only knew that Ahti’s people</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long ago together perished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the raven also answered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his people had been scattered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the swords, and spears, and arrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his enemies from Pohya.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Faithful mother, dear departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou who nursed me in my childhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art thou dead and turned to ashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Didst thou perish for my follies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er thy head are willows weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Junipers above thy body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alders watching o’er thy slumbers?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This my punishment for evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the recompense of folly!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fool was I, a son unworthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I measured swords in Northland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the landlord of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my tribe came fell destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the death of my dear mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through my crimes and misdemeanors.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the ministrel [sic] looked about him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anxious, looked in all directions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beheld some gentle foot-prints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw a pathway lightly trodden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the heather had been beaten.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick as thought the path he followed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the meadows, through the brambles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the hills, and through the valleys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a forest, vast and cheerless;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travelled far and travelled farther,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still a greater distance travelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a dense and hidden glenwood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the middle of the island;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found therein a sheltered cabin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found a small and darksome dwelling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built between the rocky ledges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the midst of triple pine-trees;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And within he spied his mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found his gray-haired mother weeping.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen loud rejoices,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cries in tones of joyful greetings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words that Ahti utters:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Faithful mother, well-beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou that gavest me existence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Happy I, that thou art living,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou hast not yet departed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the kingdom of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the islands of the blessed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I had thought that thou hadst perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hadst been murdered by my foemen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hadst been slain with bows and arrows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heavy are mine eyes from weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my checks are white with sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since I thought my mother slaughtered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the sins I had committed!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Long, indeed, hast thou been absent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long, my son, hast thou been living</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy father’s Isle of Refuge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roaming on the secret island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Living at the doors of strangers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Living in a nameless country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Refuge from the Northland foemen.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Charming is that spot for living,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful the magic island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rainbow-colored was the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blue the glimmer of the meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silvered were, the pine-tree branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden were the heather-blossoms;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the woodlands dripped with honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eggs in every rock and crevice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Honey flowed from birch and sorb-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Milk in streams from fir and aspen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beer-foam dripping from the willows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charming there to live and linger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All their edibles delicious.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This their only source of trouble:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great the fear for all the maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the heroes filled with envy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feared the coming of the stranger;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought that all the island-maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought that all the wives and daughters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the good, and all the evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave thy son too much attention;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought the stranger, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the Island-maids too often;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet the virgins I avoided,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shunned the good and shunned the evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shunned the host of charming daughters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the black-wolf shuns the sheep-fold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the hawk neglects the chickens.”</span>
