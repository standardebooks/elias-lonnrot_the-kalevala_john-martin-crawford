			<p>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called her many tribes together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave the archers bows and arrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave her brave men spears and broadswords;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fitted out her mightiest war-ship,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the vessel placed her army,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their swords a hundred heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their bows a thousand archers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick erected masts and sail-yards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the masts her sails of linen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hanging like the clouds of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the white-clouds in the ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailed across the seas of Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To re-take the wondrous Sampo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the heroes of Wainola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and faithful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailed across the deep, blue waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words to Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou daring son of Lempo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Best of all my friends and heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mount the highest of the topmasts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look before you into ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look behind you at the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well examine the horizon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether clear or filled with trouble.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Climbed the daring Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever ready for a venture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the highest of the mastheads;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked he eastward, also westward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked he northward, also southward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then addressed wise Wainamoinen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Clear the sky appears before me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But behind a dark horizon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the north a cloud is rising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a longer cloud at north-west.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen thus made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Art thou speaking truth or fiction?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am fearful that the war-ships</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Pohyola are pursuing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look again with keener vision.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked again and spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“In the distance seems a forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the south appears an island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aspen-groves with falcons laden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alders laden with the wood-grouse.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Surely thou art speaking falsehood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis no forest in the distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither aspen, birch, nor alders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laden with the grouse, or falcon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am fearful that Pohyola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Follows with her magic armies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look again with keener vision.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the daring Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked the third time from the topmast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake and these the words be uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“From the north a boat pursues us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Driven by a hundred rowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carrying a thousand heroes!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Knew at last old Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knew the truth of his inquiry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed his fleeing people:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Row, O blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Row, O mighty Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Row, all ye my noble oarsmen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That our boat may skim the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May escape from our pursuers!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rowed the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rowed the mighty Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With them rowed the other heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heavily groaned the helm of birch-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loudly rattled all the row-locks;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the vessel shook and trembled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a cataract it thundered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As it plowed the waste of waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tossing sea-foam to the heavens.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strongly rowed Wainola’s forces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strongly were their arms united;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the distance did not widen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Twixt the boat and their pursuers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick the hero, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw misfortune hanging over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw destruction in the distance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heavy-hearted, long reflecting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trouble-laden, spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Only is there one salvation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know one miracle for safety!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he grasped his box of tinder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the box he took a flint-stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the tinder took some fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast the fragments on the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words of master-magic.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let from these arise a mountain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the bottom of the deep-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let a rock arise in water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the war-ship of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her thousand men and heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May be wrecked upon the summit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the aid of surging billows.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Instantly a reef arises,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sea springs up a mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eastward, westward, through the waters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came the war-ship of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the floods the boat came steering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailed against the mountain-ledges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fastened on the rocks in water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrecked upon the Mount of Magic.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the deep-sea fell the topmasts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell the sails upon the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carried by the winds and waters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the waves of toil and trouble.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tries to free her sinking vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tries to rescue from destruction;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she cannot raise the war-ship,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Firmly fixed upon the mountain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shattered are the ribs and rudder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ruined is the ship of Pohya.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the hostess of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much disheartened, spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Where the force, in earth or heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will help a soul in trouble?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick she changes form and feature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes herself another body;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes five sharpened scythes of iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Also takes five goodly sickles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shapes them into eagle-talons;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the body of the vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes the frame-work of an eagle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the vessel’s ribs and flooring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes them into wings and breastplate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the tail she shapes the rudder;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the wings she plants a thousand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seniors with their bows and arrows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sets a thousand magic heroes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the body, armed with broadswords</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the tail a hundred archers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their deadly spears and cross-bows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the bird is hero-feathered.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick she spreads her mighty pinions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rises as a monster-eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flies on high, and soars, and circles</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With one wing she sweeps the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the other sweeps the waters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hero’s ocean-mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn thy vision to the north-east,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast thine eyes upon the sunrise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look behind thy fleeing vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See the eagle of misfortune!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen turned as bidden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned his vision to the north-east,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast his eyes upon the sunrise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There beheld the Northland-hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wicked witch of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying as a monster-eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swooping on his mighty war-ship;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flies and perches on the topmast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the sail-yards firmly settles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nearly overturns the vessel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the heroes of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Underneath the weight of envy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the hero, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned to Ukko as his refuge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus entreated his Creator:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ukko, thou O God in heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou Creator full of mercy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guard us from impending danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy children may not perish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not meet with fell destruction.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither bring thy magic fire-cloak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy people, thus protected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May resist Pohyola’s forces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well may fight against the hostess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the dismal Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not fall before her weapons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not in the deep-sea perish!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the ancient Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed the ancient Louhi:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou now divide the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the fog-point in the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the island forest-covered?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the Northland hostess answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will not divide the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not with thee, thou evil wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not with wicked Wainamoinen!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick the mighty eagle, Louhi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swoops upon the lid in colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grasps the Sampo in her talons;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the daring Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway draws his blade of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Draws his broadsword from his girdle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cleaves the talons of the eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One toe only is uninjured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these magic words of conquest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Down, ye spears, and down, ye broadswords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down, ye thousand witless heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down, ye feathered hosts of Louhi!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calling, screeching, from the sail-yards:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou faithless Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wicked wizard, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To deceive thy trusting mother!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou didst give to her thy promise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to go to war for ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to war for sixty summers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though desire for gold impels thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though thou wishest gold and silver!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal wisdom-singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thinking he had met destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snatched the rudder from the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With it smote the monster-eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smote the eagle’s iron talons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smote her countless feathered heroes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From her breast her hosts descended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spearmen fell upon the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the wings descend a thousand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the tail, a hundred archers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swoops again the bird of Pohya</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bottom of the vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the hawk from birch or aspen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the falcon from the linden;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grasps the Sampo with one talon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drags the treasure to the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drops the magic lid in colors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the red rim of the war-ship</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bottom of the deep-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the Sampo breaks in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scatters through the Alue-waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mighty deeps for ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To increase the ocean’s treasures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Treasures for the hosts of Ahto.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nevermore will there be wanting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Richness for the Ahto-nation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never while the moonlight brightens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the waters of the Northland.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Many fragments of the Sampo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Floated on the purple waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the waters deep and boundless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocked by winds and waves of Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carried by the rolling billows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the sea-sides of Wainola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the fragments of the treasure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Floating on the billows landward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fragments of the lid in colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much rejoicing, spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thence will come the sprouting seed-grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The beginning of good fortune,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The unending of resources,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the plowing and the sowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the glimmer of the moonlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the splendor of the sunshine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the fertile plains of Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the meads of Kalevala.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed old Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Know I other mighty measures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know I means that are efficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And against thy golden moonlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the splendor of thy sunshine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thy plowing, and thy reaping;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the rocks I’ll sink the moonbeams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hide the sun within the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the frost destroy thy sowings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze the crops on all thy corn-fields;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Iron-hail I’ll send from heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the richness of thine acres,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the barley of thy planting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will drive the bear from forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send thee Otso from the thickets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he may destroy thy cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May annihilate thy sheep-folds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May destroy thy steeds at pasture.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will send thee nine diseases,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each more fatal than the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will sicken all thy people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make thy children sink and perish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nevermore to visit Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never while the moonlight glimmers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the plains of Kalevala!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the ancient bard made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not a Laplander can banish</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen and his people;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never can a Turyalander</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive my tribes from Kalevala;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God alone has power to banish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God controls the fate of nations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never trusts the arms of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never gives His strength to others.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I trust in my Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call upon benignant Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will guard my crops from danger</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive the Frost-fiend from my corn-fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive great Otso to his caverns.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Wicked Louhi of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst banish evil-doers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the rocks canst hide the wicked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy mountains lock the guilty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst never hide the moonlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never bide the silver sunshine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the caverns of thy kingdom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze the crops of thine own planting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze the barley of thy sowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send thine iron-hail from heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To destroy the Lapland corn-fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To annihilate thy people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To destroy the hosts of Pohya;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send great Otso from the heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send the sharp-tooth from the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the fields of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the herds and flocks of Louhi!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus the wicked hostess answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“All my power has departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my strength has gone to others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my hope is in the deep-sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the waters lies my Sampo!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the hostess of Pohyola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Home departed, weeping, wailing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the land of cold and darkness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only took some worthless fragments</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Sampo to her people;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carried she the lid to Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the blue-sea left the handle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hence the poverty of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the famines of Pohyola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to the broad-sea’s margin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stepped upon the shore in joyance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found there fragments of the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fragments of the lid in colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the borders of the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the curving sands and sea-sides;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathered well the Sampo-relics</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the waters near the fog-point,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the island forest-covered.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in supplication:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Grant, O Ukko, our Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant to us, thy needful children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peace, and happiness, and plenty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That our lives may be successful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That our days may end in honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the vales and hills of Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the prairies of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the homes of Kalevala!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ukko, wise and good Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ukko, God of love and mercy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shelter and protect thy people</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the evil-minded heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the wiles of wicked women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That our country’s plagues may leave us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy faithful tribes may prosper.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be our friend and strong protector,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be the helper of thy children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the night a roof above them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the day a shield around them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the sunshine may not vanish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the moonlight may not lessen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the killing frosts may leave them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And destructive hail pass over.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Build a metal wall around us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the valleys to the heavens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Build of stone a mighty fortress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the borders of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where thy people live and labor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As their dwelling-place forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sure protection to thy people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the wicked may not enter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the thieves break through and pilfer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never while the moonlight glistens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Sun brings golden blessings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the plains of Kalevala.”</span>
