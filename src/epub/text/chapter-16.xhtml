			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal wisdom-singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his boat was working lumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Working long upon his vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a fog-point jutting seaward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On an island, forest-covered;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the lumber failed the master,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beams were wanting for his vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beams and scantling, ribs and flooring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will find for him the lumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who procure the timber needed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the boat of Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the bottom of his vessel?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pellerwoinen of the prairies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sampsa, slender-grown and ancient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will seek the needful timber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He procure the beams of oak-wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the boat of Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the bottom of his vessel.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon he starts upon his journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the eastern fields and forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hunts throughout the Northland mountain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a second mountain wanders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a third he hastens, searching,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden axe upon his shoulder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his hand a copper hatchet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comes an aspen-tree to meet him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the height of seven fathoms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sampsa takes his axe of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Starts to fell the stately aspen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the aspen quickly halting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words to Pellerwoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tell me, hero, what thou wishest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the service thou art needing?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sampsa Pellerwoinen answers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This indeed, the needed service</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I ask of thee, O aspen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Need thy lumber for a vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the boat of Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wisest of the wisdom-singers.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick and wisely speaks the aspen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus its hundred branches answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“All the boats that have been fashioned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my wood have proved but failures;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such a vessel floats a distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then it sinks upon the bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the waters it should travel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my trunk is filled with hollows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three times in the summer seasons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worms devour my stem and branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed upon my heart and tissues.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pellerwoinen leaves the aspen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hunts again through all the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanders through the woods of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where a pine-tree comes to meet him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the height of fourteen fathoms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With his axe he chops the pine-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes it with his axe of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he asks the pine this question:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Will thy trunk give worthy timber</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the boat of Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wisest of the wisdom-singers?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loudly does the pine-tree answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“All the ships that have been fashioned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my body are unworthy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am full of imperfections,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot give thee needed timber</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewithal to build thy vessel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ravens live within my branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Build their nests and hatch their younglings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three times in my trunk in summer.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sampsa leaves the lofty pine-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanders onward, onward, onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the woods of gladsome summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where an oak-tree comes to meet him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In circumference, three fathoms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the oak he thus addresses:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ancient oak-tree, will thy body</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Furnish wood to build a vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Build a boat for Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Master-boat for the magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wisest of the wisdom-singers?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the oak replies to Sampsa:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I for thee will gladly furnish</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wood to build the hero’s vessel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am tall, and sound, and hardy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have no flaws within my body;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three times in the months of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the warmest of the seasons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does the sun dwell in my tree-top,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On my trunk the moonlight glimmers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my branches sings the cuckoo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my top her nestlings slumber.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the ancient Pellerwoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the hatchet from his shoulder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes his axe with copper handle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chops the body of the oak-tree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well he knows the art of chopping.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon he fells the tree majestic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fells the mighty forest-monarch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his magic axe and power.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the stems he lops the branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Splits the trunk in many pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fashions lumber for the bottom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Countless boards, and ribs, and braces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the singer’s magic vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the boat of the magician.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and skilful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal wonder-worker,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Builds his vessel with enchantment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Builds his boat by art of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the timber of the oak-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From its posts, and planks, and flooring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings a song, and joins the frame-work;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings a second, sets the siding;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings a third time, sets the row-locks;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fashions oars, and ribs, and rudder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joins the sides and ribs together.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the ribs were firmly fastened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the sides were tightly jointed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then alas! three words were wanting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lost the words of master-magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to fasten in the ledges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the stern should be completed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How complete the boat’s forecastle.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wise and wonderful enchanter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heavy-hearted spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Woe is me, my life hard-fated!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never will this magic vessel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass in safety o’er the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never ride the rough sea-billows.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he thought and long considered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where to find these words of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Find the lost-words of the Master:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“From the brains of countless swallows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the heads of swans in dying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the plumage of the gray-duck?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For these words the hero searches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kills of swans a goodly number,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kills a flock of fattened gray-duck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kills of swallows countless numbers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot find the words of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the lost-words of the Master.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen, wisdom-singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still reflected and debated:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I perchance may find the lost-words</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the tongue of summer-reindeer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mouth of the white squirrel.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now again he hunts the lost-words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastes to find the magic sayings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kills a countless host of reindeer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kills a rafterful of squirrels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds of words a goodly number,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But they are of little value,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot find the magic lost-word.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long he thought and well considered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I can find of words a hundred</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dwellings of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Manala fields and castles.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen quickly journeys</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the kingdom of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to find the ancient wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to learn the secret doctrine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens on through fen and forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over meads and over marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the ever-rising woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Journeys one week through the brambles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a second through the hazels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the junipers the third week,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When appear Tuoni’s islands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Manala fields and castles.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, brave and ancient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calls aloud in tones of thunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Tuonela deeps and dungeons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to Manala’s magic castle:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Bring a boat, Tuoni’s daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring a ferry-boat, O maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That may bear me o’er this channel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er this black and fatal river.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick the daughter of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Magic maid of little stature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tiny virgin of Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tiny washer of the linen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tiny cleaner of the dresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the river of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Manala’s ancient castles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words to Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives this answer to his calling:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Straightway will I bring the row-boat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the reasons thou hast given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why thou comest to Manala</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a hale and active body.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and artful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives this answer to the maiden:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I was brought here by Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mana raised me from the coffin.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks the maiden of Manala:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This a tale of wretched liars;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had Tuoni brought thee hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mana raised thee from the coffin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Tuoni would be with thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Manalainen too would lead thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Tuoni’s hat upon thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On thy hands, the gloves of Mana;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell the truth now, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What has brought thee to Manala?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, artful hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives this answer, still finessing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Iron brought me to Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the kingdom of Tuoni.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Speaks the virgin of the death-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mana’s wise and tiny daughter:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Well I know that this is falsehood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had the iron brought thee hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought thee to Tuoni’s kingdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blood would trickle from thy vesture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the blood-drops, scarlet-colored.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak the truth now, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the third time that I ask thee.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, little heeding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still finesses to the daughter:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Water brought me to Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the kingdom of Tuoni.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the tiny maiden’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Well I know thou speakest falsely;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the waters of Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the cataract and whirlpool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the waves had brought thee hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From thy robes the drops would trickle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Water drip from all thy raiment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell the truth and I will serve thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What has brought thee to Manala?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the wilful Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Told this falsehood to the maiden:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fire has brought me to Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the kingdom of Tuoni.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake again Tuoni’s daughter:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Well I know the voice of falsehood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the fire had brought thee hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought thee to Tuoni’s empire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singed would be thy locks and eyebrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thy beard be crisped and tangled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, thou foolish Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I row thee o’er the ferry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou must speak the truth in answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the last time I will ask thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make an end of thy deception.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What has brought thee to Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still unharmed by pain or sickness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still untouched by Death’s dark angels?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“At the first I spake, not truly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now I give thee rightful answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I a boat with ancient wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fashioned with my powers of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang one day and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the third day until evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I broke the magic main-spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broke my magic sledge in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my song the fleetest runners;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I come to Mana’s kingdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came to borrow here a hatchet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to mend my sledge of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to join the parts together.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send the boat now quickly over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send me, quick, Tuoni’s row-boat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Help me cross this fatal river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cross the channel of Manala.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the daughter of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mana’s maiden thus replying:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou art sure a stupid fellow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foresight wanting, judgment lacking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Having neither wit nor wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coming here without a reason,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coming to Tuoni’s empire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better far if thou shouldst journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy distant home and kindred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many they that visit Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Few return from Mana’s kingdom.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the good old Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Women old retreat from danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a man of any courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the weakest of the heroes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring thy boat, Tuoni’s daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tiny maiden of Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come and row me o’er the ferry.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mana’s daughter does as bidden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings her boat to Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly rows him through the channel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the black and fatal river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the kingdom of Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words to the magician:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Woe to thee! O Wainamoinen!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wonderful indeed, thy magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since thou comest to Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comest neither dead nor dying.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Tuonetar, the death-land hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient hostess of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings him pitchers filled with strong-beer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fills her massive golden goblets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these measures to the stranger:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Drink, thou ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drink the beer of king Tuoni!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, wise and cautious,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carefully inspects the liquor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looks a long time in the pitchers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees the spawning of the black-frogs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees the young of poison-serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lizards, worms, and writhing adders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addresses Tuonetar:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have not come with this intention,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have not come to drink thy poisons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drink the beer of Tuonela;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those that drink Tuoni’s liquors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those that sip the cups of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Court the Devil and destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>End their lives in want and ruin.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tuonetar makes this answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ancient minstrel, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me what has brought thee hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought thee to the realm of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the courts of Tuonela,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere Tuoni sent his angels</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy home in Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to cut thy magic life-thread.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the singer, Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I was building me a vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At my craft was working, singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Needed three words of the Master,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to fasten in the ledges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the stern should be completed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How complete the boat’s forecastle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the reason of my coming</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the empire of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the castles of Manala:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came to learn these magic sayings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Learn the lost-words of the Master.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess, Tuonetar:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mana never gives these sayings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Canst not learn them from Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the lost-words of the Master;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt never leave this kingdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never in thy magic lifetime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never go to Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Wainola’s peaceful meadows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy distant home and country.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick the hostess, Tuonetar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waves her magic wand of slumber</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the head of Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Puts to rest the wisdom-hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lays him on the couch of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the robes of living heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep the sleep that settles o’er him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In Manala lived a woman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the kingdom of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evil witch and toothless wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spinner of the threads of iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moulder of the bands of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weaver of a hundred fish-nets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a thousand nets of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spinning in the days of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weaving in the winter evenings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seated on a rock in water.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the kingdom of Tuoni</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lived a man, a wicked wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three the fingers of the hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spinner he of iron meshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maker too of nets of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Countless were his nets of metal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moulded on a rock in water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the many days of summer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mana’s son with crooked fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Iron-pointed, copper fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pulls of nets, at least a thousand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the river of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sets them lengthwise, sets them crosswise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the fatal, darksome river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the sleeping Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Friend and brother of the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not leave the isle of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never in the course of ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never leave the death-land castles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never while the moonlight glimmers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the empire of Tuoni.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, wise and wary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rising from his couch of slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words as he is waking:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is there not some mischief brewing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Am I not at last in danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the chambers of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Manala home and household?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick he changes his complexion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Changes too his form and feature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slips into another body;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a serpent in a circle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolls black-dyed upon the waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a snake among the willows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crawls he like a worm of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like an adder through the grasses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the coal-black stream of death-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through a thousand nets of copper</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Interlaced with threads of iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the kingdom of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the castles of Manala.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mana’s son, the wicked wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his iron-pointed fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the early morning hastens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his thousand nets of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set within the Tuoni river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds therein a countless number</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the death-stream fish and serpents;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not find old Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen, wise and wary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Friend and fellow of the waters.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the wonder-working hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had escaped from Tuonela,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake he thus in supplication:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Gratitude to thee, O Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do I bring for thy protection!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never suffer other heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of thy heroes not the wisest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To transgress the laws of nature;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never let another singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While he lives within the body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cross the river of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou lovest thy creations.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many heroes cross the channel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cross the fatal stream of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Few return to tell the story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Few return from Tuonela,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Manala’s courts and castles.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen calls his people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the plains of Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words of ancient wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the young men, to the maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the rising generation:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Every child of Northland, listen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou wishest joy eternal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never disobey thy parents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never evil treat the guiltless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never wrong the feeble-minded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never harm thy weakest fellow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never stain thy lips with falsehood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never cheat thy trusting neighbor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never injure thy companion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest thou surely payest penance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the kingdom of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the prison of Manala;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There, the home of all the wicked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the couch of the unworthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the chambers of the guilty.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Underneath Manala’s fire-rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are their ever-flaming couches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For their pillows hissing serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vipers green their writhing covers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For their drink the blood of adders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For their food the pangs of hunger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pain and agony their solace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou wishest joy eternal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shun the kingdom of Tuoni!”</span>
