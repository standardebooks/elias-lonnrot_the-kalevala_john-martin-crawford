<p>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br/>
Swam through all the deep-sea waters,<br/>
Floating like a branch of aspen,<br/>
Like a withered twig of willow;<br/>
Swam six days in summer weather,<br/>
Swam six nights in golden moonlight;<br/>
Still before him rose the billows,<br/>
And behind him sky and ocean.<br/>
Two days more he swam undaunted,<br/>
Two long nights be struggled onward.<br/>
On the evening of the eighth day,<br/>
Wainamoinen grew disheartened,<br/>
Felt a very great discomfort,<br/>
For his feet had lost their toe-nails,<br/>
And his fingers dead and dying.<br/>
Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,<br/>
Sad and weary, spake as follows:<br/>
“Woe is me, my old life fated!<br/>
Woe is me, misfortune’s offspring!<br/>
Fool was I when fortune, favored,<br/>
To forsake my home and kindred,<br/>
For a maiden fair and lovely,<br/>
Here beneath the starry heavens,<br/>
In this cruel waste of waters,<br/>
Days and nights to swim and wander,<br/>
Here to struggle with the storm-winds,<br/>
To be tossed by heaving billows,<br/>
In this broad sea’s great expanses,<br/>
In this ocean vast and boundless.<br/>
“Cold my life and sad and dreary,<br/>
Painful too for me to linger<br/>
Evermore within these waters,<br/>
Thus to struggle for existence!<br/>
Cannot know how I can prosper,<br/>
How to find me food and shelter,<br/>
In these cold and lifeless waters,<br/>
In these days of dire misfortune.<br/>
Build I in the winds my dwelling?<br/>
It will find no sure foundation.<br/>
Build my home upon the billows?<br/>
Surely would the waves destroy it.”<br/>
Comes a bird from far Pohyola,<br/>
From the occident, an eagle,<br/>
Is not classed among the largest,<br/>
Nor belongs he to the smallest;<br/>
One wing touches on the waters,<br/>
While the other sweeps the heavens;<br/>
O’er the waves he wings his body,<br/>
Strikes his beak upon the sea-cliffs,<br/>
Flies about, then safely perches,<br/>
Looks before him, looks behind him,<br/>
There beholds brave Wainamoinen,<br/>
On the blue-back of the ocean,<br/>
And the eagle thus accosts him:<br/>
“Wherefore art thou, ancient hero,<br/>
Swimming in the deep-sea billows?<br/>
Thus the water-minstrel answered:<br/>
“I am ancient Wainamoinen,<br/>
Friend and fellow of the waters<br/>
I, the famous wisdom-singer;<br/>
Went to woo a Northland maiden,<br/>
Maiden from the dismal Darkland,<br/>
Quickly galloped on my journey,<br/>
Riding on the plain of ocean.<br/>
I arrived one morning early,<br/>
At the breaking of the day-dawn.<br/>
At the bay of Luotola,<br/>
Near Youkola’s foaming river,<br/>
Where the evil Youkahainen<br/>
Slew my steed with bow and arrow,<br/>
Tried to slay me with his weapons.<br/>
On the waters fell I headlong,<br/>
Plunged beneath the salt-sea’s surface,<br/>
From the saddle of the courser,<br/>
From my dappled steed of magic.<br/>
“Then arose a mighty storm-wind,<br/>
From the East and West a whirlwind,<br/>
Washed me seaward on the surges,<br/>
Seaward, seaward, further, further,<br/>
Where for many days I wandered,<br/>
Swam and rocked upon the billows,<br/>
Where as many nights I struggled,<br/>
In the dashing waves and sea-foam,<br/>
With the angry winds and waters.<br/>
“Woe is me, my life hard-fated!<br/>
Cannot solve this heavy problem,<br/>
How to live nor how to perish<br/>
In this cruel salt-sea water.<br/>
Build I in the winds my dwelling?<br/>
It will find no sure foundation.<br/>
Build my home upon the waters?<br/>
Surely will the waves destroy it.<br/>
Must I swim the sea forever,<br/>
Must I live, or must I perish?<br/>
What will happen if I perish,<br/>
If I sink below the billows,<br/>
Perish here from cold and hunger?”<br/>
Thus the bird of Ether answered<br/>
“Be not in the least disheartened,<br/>
Place thyself between my shoulders,<br/>
On my back be firmly seated,<br/>
I will lift thee from the waters,<br/>
Bear thee with my pinions upward,<br/>
Bear thee wheresoe’er thou willest.<br/>
Well do I the day remember<br/>
Where thou didst the eagle service,<br/>
When thou didst the birds a favor.<br/>
Thou didst leave the birch-tree standing,<br/>
When were cleared the Osmo-forests,<br/>
From the lands of Kalevala,<br/>
As a home for weary song-birds,<br/>
As a resting-place for eagles.”<br/>
Then arises Wainamoinen,<br/>
Lifts his head above the waters,<br/>
Boldly rises from the sea-waves,<br/>
Lifts his body from the billows,<br/>
Seats himself upon the eagle,<br/>
On the eagle’s feathered shoulders.<br/>
Quick aloft the huge bird bears him,<br/>
Bears the ancient Wainamoinen,<br/>
Bears him on the path of zephyrs,<br/>
Floating on the vernal breezes,<br/>
To the distant shore of Northland,<br/>
To the dismal Sariola,<br/>
Where the eagle leaves his burden,<br/>
Flies away to join his fellows.<br/>
Wainamoinen, lone and weary,<br/>
Straightway fell to bitter weeping,<br/>
Wept and moaned in heavy accents,<br/>
On the border of the blue-sea.<br/>
On a cheerless promontory,<br/>
With a hundred wounds tormented,<br/>
Made by cruel winds and waters,<br/>
With his hair and beard dishevelled<br/>
By the surging of the billows.<br/>
Three long days he wept disheartened<br/>
Wept as many nights in anguish,<br/>
Did not know what way to journey,<br/>
Could not find a woodland foot-print,<br/>
That would point him to the highway,<br/>
To his home in Kalevala,<br/>
To his much-loved home and kindred.<br/>
Northland’s young and slender maiden,<br/>
With complexion fair and lovely,<br/>
With the Sun had laid a wager,<br/>
With the Sun and Moon a wager,<br/>
Which should rise before the other,<br/>
On the morning of the morrow.<br/>
And the maiden rose in beauty,<br/>
Long before the Sun had risen,<br/>
Long before the Moon bad wakened,<br/>
From their beds beneath the ocean.<br/>
Ere the cock had crowed the day-break,<br/>
Ere the Sun had broken slumber<br/>
She had sheared six gentle lambkins,<br/>
Gathered from them six white fleeces,<br/>
Hence to make the rolls for spinning,<br/>
Hence to form the threads for weaving,<br/>
Hence to make the softest raiment,<br/>
Ere the morning dawn had broken,<br/>
Ere the sleeping Sun had risen.<br/>
When this task the maid had ended,<br/>
Then she scrubbed the birchen tables,<br/>
Sweeps the ground-floor of the stable,<br/>
With a broom of leaves and branches<br/>
From the birches of the Northland,<br/>
Scrapes the sweepings well together<br/>
On a shovel made of copper,<br/>
Carries them beyond the stable,<br/>
From the doorway to the meadow,<br/>
To the meadow’s distant border,<br/>
Near the surges of the great-sea,<br/>
Listens there and looks about her,<br/>
Hears a wailing from the waters,<br/>
Hears a weeping from the sea-shore,<br/>
Hears a hero-voice lamenting.<br/>
Thereupon she hastens homeward,<br/>
Hastens to her mother’s dwelling,<br/>
These the words the maiden utters:<br/>
“I have heard a wail from ocean,<br/>
Heard a weeping from the sea-coast,<br/>
On the shore some one lamenting.”<br/>
Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br/>
Ancient, toothless dame of Northland,<br/>
Hastens from her door and court-yard,<br/>
Through the meadow to the sea-shore,<br/>
Listens well for sounds of weeping,<br/>
For the wail of one in sorrow;<br/>
Hears the voice of one in trouble,<br/>
Hears a hero-cry of anguish.<br/>
Thus the ancient Louhi answers:<br/>
“This is not the wail of children,<br/>
These are not the tears of women,<br/>
In this way weep bearded heroes;<br/>
This the hero-cry of anguish.”<br/>
Quick she pushed her boat to water,<br/>
To the floods her goodly vessel,<br/>
Straightway rows with lightning swiftness,<br/>
To the weeping Wainamoinen;<br/>
Gives the hero consolation,<br/>
Comfort gives she to the minstrel<br/>
Wailing in a grove of willows,<br/>
In his piteous condition,<br/>
Mid the alder-trees and aspens,<br/>
On the border of the salt-sea,<br/>
Visage trembling, locks dishevelled.<br/>
Ears, and eyes, and lips of sadness.<br/>
Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br/>
Thus addresses Wainamoinen:<br/>
“Tell me what has been thy folly,<br/>
That thou art in this condition.”<br/>
Old and truthful Wainamoinen<br/>
Lifts aloft his bead and answers:<br/>
“Well I know that it is folly<br/>
That has brought me all this trouble,<br/>
Brought me to this land of strangers,<br/>
To these regions unbefitting<br/>
Happy was I with my kindred,<br/>
In my distant home and country,<br/>
There my name was named in honor.”<br/>
Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br/>
Thus replied to Wainamoinen:<br/>
“I would gain the information,<br/>
Should I be allowed to ask thee,<br/>
Who thou art of ancient heroes,<br/>
Who of all the host of heroes?<br/>
This is Wainamoinen’s answer:<br/>
“Formerly my name was mentioned,<br/>
Often was I heard and honored,<br/>
As a minstrel and magician,<br/>
In the long and dreary winters,<br/>
Called the Singer of the Northland,<br/>
In the valleys of Wainola,<br/>
On the plains of Kalevala;<br/>
No one thought that such misfortune<br/>
Could befall wise Wainamoinen.”<br/>
Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br/>
Thus replied in cheering accents<br/>
“Rise, O hero, from discomfort,<br/>
From thy bed among the willows;<br/>
Enter now upon the new-way,<br/>
Come with me to yonder dwelling,<br/>
There relate thy strange adventures,<br/>
Tell the tale of thy misfortunes.”<br/>
Now she takes the hapless hero,<br/>
Lifts him from his bed of sorrow,<br/>
In her boat she safely seats him,<br/>
And begins at once her rowing,<br/>
Rows with steady hand and mighty<br/>
To her home upon the sea-shore,<br/>
To the dwellings of Pohyola.<br/>
There she feeds the starving hero,<br/>
Rests the ancient Wainamoinen,<br/>
Gives him warmth, and food, and shelter,<br/>
And the hero soon recovers.<br/>
Then the hostess of Pohyola<br/>
Questioned thus the ancient singer:<br/>
“Wherefore didst thou, Wainamoinen,<br/>
Friend and fellow of the waters,<br/>
Weep in sad and bitter accents,<br/>
On the border of the ocean,<br/>
Mid the aspens and the willows?”<br/>
This is Wainamoinen’s answer:<br/>
Had good reason for my weeping,<br/>
Cause enough for all my sorrow;<br/>
Long indeed had I been swimming,<br/>
Had been buffeting the billows,<br/>
In the far outstretching waters.<br/>
This the reason for my weeping;<br/>
I have lived in toil and torture,<br/>
Since I left my home and country,<br/>
Left my native land and kindred,<br/>
Came to this the land of strangers,<br/>
To these unfamiliar portals.<br/>
All thy trees have thorns to wound me,<br/>
All thy branches, spines to pierce me,<br/>
Even birches give me trouble,<br/>
And the alders bring discomfort,<br/>
My companions, winds and waters,<br/>
Only does the Sun seem friendly,<br/>
In this cold and cruel country,<br/>
Near these unfamiliar portals.”<br/>
Louhi thereupon made answer,<br/>
Weep no longer, Wainamoinen,<br/>
Grieve no more, thou friend of waters,<br/>
Good for thee, that thou shouldst linger<br/>
At our friendly homes and firesides;<br/>
Thou shalt live with us and welcome,<br/>
Thou shalt sit at all our tables,<br/>
Eat the salmon from our platters,<br/>
Eat the sweetest of our bacon,<br/>
Eat the whiting from our waters.”<br/>
Answers thus old Wainamoinen,<br/>
Grateful for the invitation:<br/>
“Never do I court strange tables,<br/>
Though the food be rare and toothsome;<br/>
One’s own country is the dearest,<br/>
One’s own table is the sweetest,<br/>
One’s own home, the most attractive.<br/>
Grant, kind Ukko, God above me,<br/>
Thou Creator, full of mercy,<br/>
Grant that I again may visit<br/>
My beloved home and country.<br/>
Better dwell in one’s own country,<br/>
There to drink Its healthful waters<br/>
From the simple cups of birch-wood,<br/>
Than in foreign lands to wander,<br/>
There to drink the rarest liquors<br/>
From the golden bowls of strangers.”<br/>
Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br/>
Thus replied to the magician:<br/>
“What reward wilt thou award me,<br/>
Should I take thee where thou willest,<br/>
To thy native land and kindred,<br/>
To thy much-loved home and fireside,<br/>
To the meadows of Wainola,<br/>
To the plains of Kalevala?”<br/>
These the words of Wainamoinen:<br/>
“What would be reward sufficient,<br/>
Shouldst thou take me to my people,<br/>
To my home and distant country,<br/>
To the borders of the Northland,<br/>
There to hear the cuckoo singing,<br/>
Hear the sacred cuckoo calling?<br/>
Shall I give thee golden treasures,<br/>
Fill thy cups with finest silver?”<br/>
This is Louhi’s simple answer:<br/>
“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,<br/>
Only true and wise magician,<br/>
Never will I ask for riches,<br/>
Never ask for gold nor silver;<br/>
Gold is for the children’s flowers,<br/>
Silver for the stallion’s jewels.<br/>
Canst thou forge for me the Sampo,<br/>
Hammer me the lid in colors,<br/>
From the tips of white-swan feathers<br/>
From the milk of greatest virtue,<br/>
From a single grain of barley,<br/>
From the finest wool of lambkins?<br/>
“I will give thee too my daughter,<br/>
Will reward thee through the maiden,<br/>
Take thee to thy much-loved home-land,<br/>
To the borders of Wainola,<br/>
There to hear the cuckoo singing,<br/>
Hear the sacred cuckoo calling.”<br/>
Wainamoinen, much regretting,<br/>
Gave this answer to her question:<br/>
“Cannot forge for thee the Sampo,<br/>
Cannot make the lid in colors.<br/>
Take me to my distant country,<br/>
I will send thee Ilmarinen,<br/>
He will forge for thee the Sampo,<br/>
Hammer thee the lid in colors,<br/>
He may win thy lovely maiden;<br/>
Worthy smith is Ilmarinen,<br/>
In this art is first and master;<br/>
He, the one that forged the heavens.<br/>
Forged the air a hollow cover;<br/>
Nowhere see we hammer-traces,<br/>
Nowhere find a single tongs-mark.”<br/>
Thus replied the hostess, Louhi:<br/>
“Him alone I’ll give my daughter,<br/>
Promise him my child in marriage,<br/>
Who for me will forge the Sampo,<br/>
Hammer me the lid in colors,<br/>
From the tips of white-swan feathers,<br/>
From the milk of greatest virtue,<br/>
From a single grain of barley,<br/>
From the finest wool of lambkins.”<br/>
Thereupon the hostess Louhi,<br/>
Harnessed quick a dappled courser,<br/>
Hitched him to her sledge of birch-wood,<br/>
Placed within it Wainamoinen,<br/>
Placed the hero on the cross-bench,<br/>
Made him ready for his journey;<br/>
Then addressed the ancient minstrel,<br/>
These the words that Louhi uttered:<br/>
“Do not raise thine eyes to heaven,<br/>
Look not upward on thy journey,<br/>
While thy steed is fresh and frisky,<br/>
While the day-star lights thy pathway,<br/>
Ere the evening star has risen;<br/>
If thine eyes be lifted upward,<br/>
While the day-star lights thy pathway,<br/>
Dire misfortune will befall thee,<br/>
Some sad fate will overtake thee.”<br/>
Then the ancient Wainamoinen<br/>
Fleetly drove upon his journey,<br/>
Merrily he hastened homeward,<br/>
Hastened homeward, happy-hearted<br/>
From the ever-darksome Northland<br/>
From the dismal Sariola.</p>
