			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>Kullerwoinen, wicked wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his purple-colored stockings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now prepares himself for battle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grinds a long time on his broadsword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sharpens well his trusty weapon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his mother speaks as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do not go, my son beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go not to the wars, my hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struggle not with hostile spearsmen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whoso goes to war for nothing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Undertakes a fearful combat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Undertakes a fatal issue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those that war without a reason</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will be slaughtered for their folly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Easy prey to bows and arrows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go thou with a goat to battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou go to fight the roebuck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis the goat that will be vanquished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the roebuck will be slaughtered;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a frog thou’lt journey homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Victor, with but little honor!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Kullerwoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Shall not journey through the marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not sink upon the heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the home-land of the raven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the eagles scream at day-break.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I yield my life forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bravely will I fall in battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall upon the field of glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful to die in armor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the clang and clash of armies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful the strife for conquest!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus Kullervo soon will hasten</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the kingdom of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the realm of the departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Undeformed by wasting sickness.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of the mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If thou diest in the conflict,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will stay to guard thy father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will give thy sire protection?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Kullerwoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let him die upon the court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleeping out his life of sorrow!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Who then will protect thy mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be her shield in times of danger?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Let her die within the stable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the cabin where she lingers!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Who then will defend thy brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give him aid in times of trouble?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Let him die within the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleep his life away unheeded!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Who will comfort then thy sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will aid her in affliction?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Let her sink beneath the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perish in the crystal fountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the brook flows on in beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a silver serpent winding</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the valley to the ocean!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the wild Kullervo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens from his home to battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his father speaks, departing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fare thou well, my aged father!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou weep for me, thy hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thou hearest I have perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fallen from thy tribe forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perished on the field of glory?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the father speaks in answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I shall never mourn the downfall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my evil son, Kullervo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not weep when thou hast perished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall beget a second hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will do me better service,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will think and act in wisdom.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen gives this answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Neither shall I mourn thy downfall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not weep when thou hast perished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall make a second father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the head from loam and sandstone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the eyes from swamp-land berries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the beard from withered sea-grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the feet from roots of willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the form from birch-wood fungus.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the youth, Kullervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his brother speaks as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fare thou well, beloved brother!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou weep for me departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou hear that I have perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fallen on the field of battle?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of the brother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I shall never mourn the downfall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my brother, Kullerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not weep when thou hast perished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall find a second brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Find one worthier and wiser!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is Kullerwoinen’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Neither shall I mourn thy downfall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not weep when thou hast perished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall form a second brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the head from dust and ashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the eyes from pearls of ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the beard from withered verdure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the form from pulp of birch-wood.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his sister speaks Kullervo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fare thou well, beloved sister!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely thou wilt mourn my downfall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep for me when I have perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thou hearest I have fallen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the heat and din of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fallen from thy race forever!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the sister makes this answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Never shall I mourn thy downfall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not weep when thou hast perished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall seek a second brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seek a brother, purer, better,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One that will not shame his sister!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen thus makes answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Neither shall I mourn thee fallen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not weep when thou hast perished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall form a second sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the head from whitened marble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the eyes from golden moonbeams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the tresses from the rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the ears from ocean-flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And her form from gold and silver.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Fare thou well, beloved mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mother, beautiful and faithful!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou weep when I have perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fallen on the field of glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fallen from thy race forever?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the mother speaks in answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Canst not fathom love maternal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Canst not smother her affection;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bitterly I’ll mourn thy downfall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would weep if thou shouldst perish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou leave my race forever;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would weep in court or cabin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sprinkle all these fields with tear-drops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep great rivers to the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep to melt the snows of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the hillocks green with weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep at morning, weep at evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep three years in bitter sorrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the death of Kullerwoinen!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the wicked wizard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went rejoicing to the combat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In delight to war he hastened</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the fields, and fens, and fallows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouting loudly on the heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing o’er the hills and mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rushing through the glens and forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blowing war upon his bugle.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Time had gone but little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a messenger appearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words to Kullerwoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lo! thine aged sire has perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fallen from thy race forever;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hasten home and do him honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay him in the lap of Kalma.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen made this answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Has my aged father perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is home a sable stallion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will take him to his slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay him in the lap of Kalma.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Kullervo journeyed onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calling war upon his bugle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till a messenger appearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought this word to Kullerwoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lo! thy brother too has perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dead he lies within the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Manalainen’s trumpet called him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Home return and do him honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay him in the lap of Kalma.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen thus replying:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Has my hero-brother perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is home a sable stallion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will take him to his slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay him in the lap of Kalma.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Young Kullervo journeyed onward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over vale and over mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Playing on his reed of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till a messenger appearing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought the warrior these tidings:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lo! thy sister too has perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perished in the crystal fountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the waters flow in beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a silver serpent winding</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the valley to the ocean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Home return and do her honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay her in the lap of Kalma.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Kullerwoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Has my beauteous sister perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fallen from my race forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is home a sable filly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will take her to her resting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay her in the lap of Kalma.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still Kullervo journeyed onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the fens he went rejoicing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sounding war upon his bugle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till a messenger appearing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought to him these words of sorrow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lo! thy mother too has perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Died in anguish, broken-hearted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Home return and do her honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay her in the lap of Kalma.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the measures of Kullervo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Woe is me, my life hard-fated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That my mother too has perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She that nursed me in my cradle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made my couch a golden cover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Twirled for me the spool and spindle!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! Kullervo was not present</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When his mother’s life departed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May have died upon the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perished there from cold and hunger.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lave the dead form of my mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the crystal waters flowing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrap her in the robes of ermine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tie her hands with silken ribbon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take her to the grave of ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay her in the lap of Kalma.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bury her with songs of mourning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the singers chant my sorrow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot leave the fields of battle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While Untamo goes unpunished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell destroyer of my people.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kullerwoinen journeyed onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still rejoicing, to the combat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang these songs in supplication:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ukko, mightiest of rulers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loan to me thy sword of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant to me thy matchless weapon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And against a thousand armies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will war and ever conquer.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ukko gave the youth his broadsword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave his blade of magic powers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the wizard, Kullerwoinen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus equipped, the mighty hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slew the people of Untamo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burned their villages to ashes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only left the stones and ovens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the chimneys of their hamlets.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the conqueror, Kullervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned his footsteps to his home-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cabin of his father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his ancient fields and forests.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Empty did he find the cabin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the forests were deserted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one came to give him greeting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None to give the hand of welcome;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid his fingers on the oven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he found it cold and lifeless;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he knew to satisfaction</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his mother lived no longer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid his hand upon the fireplace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cold and lifeless were the hearthstones;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he knew to satisfaction</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his sister too had perished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he sought the landing-places,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found no boats upon the rollers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he knew to satisfaction</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his brother too had perished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he looked upon the fish-nets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he found them torn and tangled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he knew to satisfaction</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his father too had perished.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bitterly he wept and murmured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept one day, and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the third day spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Faithful mother, fond and tender,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why hast left me here to sorrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this wilderness of trouble?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou dost not hear my calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though I sing in magic accents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though my tear-drops speak lamenting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though my heart bemoans thine absence.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From her grave awakes the mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Kullervo speaks these measures:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou has still the dog remaining,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will lead thee to the forest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Follow thou the faithful watcher,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let him lead thee to the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the farthest woodland border,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the caverns of the wood-nymphs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the forest maidens linger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They will give thee food and shelter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give my hero joyful greetings.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kullerwoinen, with his watch-dog,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens onward through the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Journeys on through fields and fallows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Journeys but a little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he comes upon the summit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where he met his long-lost sister;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds the turf itself is weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds the glen-wood filled with sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds the heather shedding tear-drops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeping are the meadow-flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the ruin of his sister.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kullerwoinen, wicked wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grasps the handle of his broadsword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asks the blade this simple question:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tell me, O my blade of honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou wish to drink my life-blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drink the blood of Kullerwoinen?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus his trusty sword makes answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well divining his intentions:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why should I not drink thy life-blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blood of guilty Kullerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since I feast upon the worthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drink the life-blood of the righteous?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the youth, Kullervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wicked wizard of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifts the mighty sword of Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bids adieu to earth and heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Firmly thrusts the hilt in heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his heart he points the weapon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throws his weight upon his broadsword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pouring out his wicked life-blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere he journeys to Manala.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the wizard finds destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the end of Kullerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Born in sin, and nursed in folly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he hears the joyful tidings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Learns the death of fell Kullervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words of ancient wisdom:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O, ye many unborn nations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never evil nurse your children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never give them out to strangers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never trust them to the foolish!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the child is not well nurtured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is not rocked and led uprightly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though he grow to years of manhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bear a strong and shapely body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will never know discretion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never eat the bread of honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never drink the cup of wisdom.”</span>
