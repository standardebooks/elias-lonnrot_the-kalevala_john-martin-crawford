			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long considered, long debated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to woo and win the daughter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to lead the Bride of Beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairy maiden of the rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the meadows of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the dismal Sariola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now he decks his magic vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Paints the boat in blue and scarlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trims in gold the ship’s forecastle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Decks the prow in molten silver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings his magic ship down gliding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the cylinders of fir-tree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now erects the masts of pine-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On each mast the sails of linen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sails of blue, and white, and scarlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woven into finest fabric.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, the magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steps aboard his wondrous vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steers the bark across the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue back of the broad-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words in sailing northward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing to the dark Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come aboard my ship, O Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come with me, thou God of mercy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To protect thine ancient hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To support thy trusting servant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the breasts of raging billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the far outstretching waters.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Rock, O winds, this wondrous vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Causing not a single ripple;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolling waves, bear ye me northward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the oar may not be needed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my journey to Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er this mighty waste of waters.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen’s beauteous sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair and goodly maid, Annikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Night and Dawn, the daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who awakes each morning early,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rises long before the daylight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood one morning on the sea-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Washing in the foam her dresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rinsing out her silken ribbons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the bridge of scarlet color,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the border of the highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a headland jutting seaward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the forest-covered island.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here Annikki, looking round her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looking through the fog and ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looking through the clouds of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gazing far out on the blue-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees the morning sun arising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glimmering along the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looks with eyes of distant vision</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the sunrise on the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the winding streams of Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the Wina-waves were flowing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There she sees, on the horizon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something darkle in the sunlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something blue upon the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words in wonder guessing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What is this upon the surges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What this blue upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What this darkling in the sunlight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis perhaps a flock of wild-geese,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or perchance the blue-duck flying;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then upon thy wings arising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly away to highest heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Art thou then a shoal of sea-trout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or perchance a school of salmon?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dive then to the deep sea-bottom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the waters swim and frolic.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Art thou then a cliff of granite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or perchance a mighty oak-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Floating on the rough sea-billows?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May the floods then wash and beat thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Break thee to a thousand fragments.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, sailing northward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steers his wondrous ship of magic</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the headland jutting seaward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the island forest-covered.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now Annikki, goodly maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees it is the magic vessel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a wonderful enchanter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a mighty bard and hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she asks this simple question:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Art thou then my father’s vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or my brother’s ship of magic?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haste away then to thy harbor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy refuge in Wainola.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast thou come a goodly distance?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sail then farther on thy journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Point thy prow to other waters.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was not her father’s vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a sail-boat from the distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Twas the ship of Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bark of the eternal singer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sails within a hailing distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swims still nearer o’er the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings one word and takes another,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings a third of magic import.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Speaks the goodly maid, Annikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Night and Dawn, the daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the sailor of the vessel:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whither sailest, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither bound, thou friend of waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pride and joy of Kalevala?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the vessel Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives this answer to the maiden:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have come to catch some sea-trout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Catch the young and toothsome whiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hiding in these reeds and rushes.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of Annikki:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Do not speak to me in falsehood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know I well the times of fishing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long ago my honored father</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was a fisherman in Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came to catch the trout and whiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fished within these seas and rivers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Very well do I remember</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the fisherman disposes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How he rigs his fishing vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lines, and gaffs, and poles, and fish-nets;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast not come a-fishing hither.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither goest, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither sailest, friend of waters?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have come to catch some wild-geese,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Catch the hissing birds of Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these far-extending borders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Sachsensund dominions.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good Annikki gives this answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Know I well a truthful speaker,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Easily detect a falsehood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Formerly my aged father</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often came a-hunting hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came to hunt the hissing wild-geese,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hunt the red-bill of these waters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Very well do I remember</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the hunter rigs his vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bows, and arrows, knives, and quiver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dogs enchained within the vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pointers hunting on the sea-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Setters seeking in the marshes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell the truth now Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither is thy vessel sailing?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hero of the Northland:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To the wars my ship is sailing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bloody fields of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the streams run scarlet-colored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the paths are paved with bodies.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of fair Annikki:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Know I well the paths to battle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Formerly my aged father</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often sounded war’s alarum,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often led the hosts to conquest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In each ship a hundred rowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in arms a thousand heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the prow a thousand crossbows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swords, and spears, and battle-axes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know I well the ship of battle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak no longer fruitless falsehoods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither sailest, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither steerest, friend of waters?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come, O maiden, to my vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my magic ship be seated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I’ll give thee truthful answer.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus Annikki, silver-tinselled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answers ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“With the winds I’ll fill thy vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy bark I’ll send the storm-winds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And capsize thy ship of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Break in pieces its forecastle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the truth thou dost not tell me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou dost not cease thy falsehoods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou dost not tell me truly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither sails thy magic vessel.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now I make thee truthful answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though at first I spake deception:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am sailing to the Northland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dismal Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the ogres live and flourish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where they drown the worthy heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to woo the Maid of Beauty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting on the bow of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woo and win the fairy virgin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring her to my home and kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the firesides of Wainola.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Annikki, graceful maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Night and Dawn, the daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As she heard the rightful answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knew the truth was fully spoken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway left her coats unbeaten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left unwashed her linen garments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left unrinsed her silks and ribbons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the highway by the sea-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the bridge of scarlet color;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her arm she threw her long-robes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened off with speed of roebuck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the shops of Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the iron-forger’s furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the blacksmith’s home and smithy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here she found the hero-artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forging out a bench of iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And adorning it with silver.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soot lay thick upon his forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soot and coal upon his shoulders.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the threshold speaks Annikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words his sister uses:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ilmarinen, dearest brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou eternal artist-forger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge me now a loom of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden rings to grace my fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge me gold and silver ear-rings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Six or seven golden girdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden crosslets for my bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For my head forge golden trinkets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I’ll tell a tale surprising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell a story that concerns thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Truthfully I’ll tell the story.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the blacksmith Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake and these the words he uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If thou’lt tell the tale sincerely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will forge the loom of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden rings to grace thy fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge thee gold and silver ear-rings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Six or seven golden girdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden crosslets for thy bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thy head forge golden trinkets;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if thou shouldst tell me falsely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall break thy beauteous jewels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Break thine ornaments in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurl them to the fire and furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never forge thee other trinkets.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of Annikki:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ancient blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou ever think to marry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her already thine affianced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beauteous Maiden of the Rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest virgin of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chosen bride of Sariola?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou wish the Maid of Beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou must forge, and forge unceasing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hammering the days and nights through;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge the summer hoofs for horses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge them iron hoofs for winter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the long nights forge the snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaily trim it in the daytime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haste thou then upon thy journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy wooing in the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dismal Sariola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thither journeys one more clever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sails another now before thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to woo thy bride affianced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence to lead thy chosen virgin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woo and win the Maid of Beauty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three long years thou hast been wooing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen now is sailing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue back of the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting at his helm of copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the prow are golden carvings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful his boat of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing fleetly o’er the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the never-pleasant Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dismal Sariola.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen stood in wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood a statue at the story;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silent grief had settled o’er him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Settled o’er the iron-artist;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From one hand the tongs descended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the other fell the hammer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the blacksmith made this answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good Annikki, worthy sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall forge the loom of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden rings to grace thy fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge thee gold and silver ear-rings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Six or seven golden girdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden crosslets for thy bosom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go and heat for me the bath-room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill with heat the honey-chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay the faggots on the fireplace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay the smaller woods around them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pour some water through the ashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make a soap of magic virtue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to cleanse my blackened visage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to cleanse the blacksmith’s body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus remove the soot and ashes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Annikki, kindly sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly warmed her brother’s bath-room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Warmed it with the knots of fir-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the thunder-winds had broken;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathered pebbles from the fire-stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threw them in the heating waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broke the tassels from the birch-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steeped the foliage in honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made a lye from milk and ashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made of these a strong decoction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mixed it with the fat and marrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the reindeer of the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made a soap of magic virtue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to cleanse the iron-artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to beautify the suitor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to make the hero worthy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen, ancient blacksmith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal metal-worker,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forged the wishes of his sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ornaments for fair Annikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rings, and bracelets, pins and ear-drops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forged for her six golden girdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forged a weaving loom of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the maid prepared the bath-room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set his toilet-room in order.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To the maid he gave the trinkets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave the loom of molten silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sister thus made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have heated well thy bath-room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have thy toilet-things in order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everything as thou desirest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go prepare thyself for wooing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lave thy head to flaxen whiteness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make thy cheeks look fresh and ruddy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lave thyself in Love’s aroma,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy wooing prove successful.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen, magic artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick repairing to his bath-room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bathed his head to flaxen whiteness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made his cheeks look fresh and ruddy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laved his eyes until they sparkled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the moonlight on the waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wondrous were his form and features,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his cheeks like ruddy berries.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Ilmarinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fair Annikki, lovely sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me now my silken raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring my best and richest vesture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me now my softest linen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That my wooing prove successful.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Straightway did the helpful sister</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring the finest of his raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring the softest of his linen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raiment fashioned by his mother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought to him his silken stockings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought him shoes of marten-leather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought a vest of sky-blue color,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought him scarlet-colored trousers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought a coat with scarlet trimming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought a red shawl trimmed in ermine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fourfold wrapped about his body;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought a fur-coat made of seal-skin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fastened with a thousand buttons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And adorned with countless jewels;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought for him his magic girdle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fastened well with golden buckles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his artist-mother fashioned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought him gloves with golden wristlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the Laplanders had woven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For a head of many ringlets;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought the finest cap in Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his ancient father purchased</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he first began his wooing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen, blacksmith-artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clad himself to look his finest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he thus addressed a servant:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hitch for me a fleet-foot racer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hitch him to my willing snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I start upon a journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the distant shores of Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dismal Sariola.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the servant thus in answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou hast seven fleet-foot racers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Munching grain within their mangers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which of these shall I make ready?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Take the fleetest of my coursers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put the gray steed in the harness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hitch him to my sledge of magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Place six cuckoos on the break-board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seven bluebirds on the cross-bars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to charm the Northland maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to make them look and listen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the cuckoos call and echo.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me too my largest bear-skin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fold it warm about the cross-bench;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me then my marten fur-robes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a cover and protection.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Straightway then the trusty servant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put the gray steed in the harness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hitched the racer to the snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Placed six cuckoos on the break-board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seven bluebirds on the cross-bars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the front to sing and twitter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he brought the largest bear-skin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Folded it upon the cross-bench;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought the finest robes of marten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Warm protection for the master.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen, forger-artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal metal-worker,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earnestly entreated Ukko:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Send thy snow-flakes, Ukko, father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let them gently fall from heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let them cover all the heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let them hide the berry-bushes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That my sledge may glide in freedom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the hills to Sariola!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ukko sent the snow from heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gently dropped the crystal snow-flakes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lending thus his kind assistance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hero, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his journey to the Northland.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Reins in hand, the ancient artist</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seats him in his metal snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beseeches thus his Master:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good luck to my reins and traces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good luck to my shafts and runners!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God protect my magic snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be my safeguard on my journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dismal Sariola!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the ancient Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Draws the reins upon the racer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snaps his whip above the courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the gray steed gives this order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the charger plunges northward:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Haste away, my flaxen stallion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haste thee onward, noble white-face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the never-pleasant Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dreary Sariola!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fast and faster flies the fleet-foot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the curving snow-capped sea-coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the borders of the lowlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the alder-hills and mountains.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Merrily the steed flies onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bluebirds singing, cuckoos calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the sea-shore looking northward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the sand and falling snow-flakes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blinding winds, and snow, and sea-foam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cloud the hero, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he glides upon his journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looking seaward for the vessel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the ancient Wainamoinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travels one day, then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travels all the next day northward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the third day Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Overtakes old Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hails him in his magic vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And addresses thus the minstrel:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us woo in peace the maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest daughter of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting on the bow of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let each labor long to win her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let her wed the one she chooses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him selecting, let her follow.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen thus makes answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I agree to thy proposal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us woo in peace the maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not by force, nor faithless measures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall we woo the Maid of Beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let her follow him she chooses;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the unsuccessful suitor</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harbor neither wrath nor envy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the hero that she follows.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus agreeing, on they journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each according to his pleasure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fleetly does the steed fly onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly flies the magic vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing on the broad-sea northward;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen’s fleet-foot racer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes the hills of Northland tremble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he gallops on his journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dismal Sariola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen calls the South-winds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they fly to his assistance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swiftly sails his ship of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swiftly plows the rough sea-billows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her pathway to Pohyola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Time had gone but little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce a moment had passed over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the dogs began their barking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mansions of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the courts of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Watch-dogs of the court of Louhi;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never had they growled so fiercely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never had they barked so loudly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never with their tails had beaten</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Northland into such an uproar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the master of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Go and learn, my worthy daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why the watch-dogs have been barking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why the black-dog signals danger.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly does the daughter answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I am occupied, dear father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have work of more importance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must tend my flock of lambkins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must turn the nether millstone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grind to flour the grains of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Run the grindings through the sifter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only have I time for grinding.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lowly growls the faithful watch-dog,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seldom does he growl so strangely.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the master of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Go and learn, my trusted consort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why the Northland dogs are barking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why the black-dog signals danger.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus his aged wife makes answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have no time, nor inclination,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must feed my hungry household,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must prepare a worthy dinner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must bake the toothsome biscuit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knead the dough till it is ready,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only have I strength for kneading.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the master of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Dames are always in a hurry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maidens too are ever busy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether warming at the oven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or asleep upon their couches;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go my son, and learn the danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why the black-dog growls displeasure.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly does the son give answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have no time, nor inclination,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Am in haste to grind my hatchet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must chop this log to cordwood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the fire must cut the faggots,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must split the wood in fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Large the pile and small the fire-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only have I strength for chopping.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still the watch-dog growls in anger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Growl the whelps within the mansion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Growl the dogs chained in the kennel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Growls the black-dog on the hill-top,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Setting Northland in an uproar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the master of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Never, never does my black-dog</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Growl like this without a reason;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never does he bark for nothing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not growl at angry billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the sighing of the pine-trees.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the master of Pohyola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went himself to learn the reason</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the barking of the watch-dogs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strode he through the spacious court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the open fields beyond it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the summit of the uplands.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looking toward his black-dog barking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He beholds the muzzle pointed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a distant, stormy hill-top,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a mound with alders covered;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There he learned the rightful reason,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why his dogs had barked so loudly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why had growled the wool-tail bearer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why his whelps had signalled danger.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At full sail, he saw a vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the ship was scarlet-colored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Entering the bay of Lempo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw a sledge of magic colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gliding up the curving sea-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the snow-fields of Pohyola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the master of the Northland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened straightway to his dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened forward to his court-room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the accents of the master:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Often strangers journey hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue back of the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing in a scarlet vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocking in the bay of Lempo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often strangers come in sledges</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the honey-lands of Louhi.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“How shall we obtain a token</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why these strangers journey hither?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My beloved, faithful daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay a branch upon the fireplace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let it burn with fire of magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If it trickle drops of scarlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>War and bloodshed do they bring us;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If it trickle drops of water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peace and plenty bring the strangers.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Northland’s fair and slender maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful and modest daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lays a sorb-branch on the fireplace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lights it with the fire of magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not trickle drops of scarlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trickles neither blood, nor water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the wand come drops of honey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the corner spake Suowakko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the language of the wizard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If the wand is dripping honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the strangers that are coming</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are but worthy friends and suitors.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the hostess of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the daughter of the hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway left their work, and hastened</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From their dwelling to the court-yard;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked about in all directions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned their eyes upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw a magic-colored vessel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocking slowly in the harbor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Having sailed the bay of Lempo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Triple sails, and masts, and rigging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sable was the nether portion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the upper, scarlet-colored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the helm an ancient hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaning on his oars of copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw a fleet-foot racer running,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw a red sledge lightly follow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the magic sledge emblazoned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guided toward the courts of Louhi;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw and heard six golden cuckoos</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting on the break-board, calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seven bluebirds richly colored</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing from the yoke and cross-bar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sledge a magic hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young, and strong, and proud, and handsome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Holding reins upon the courser.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Dearest daughter, winsome maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou wish a noble suitor?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should these heroes come to woo thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wouldst thou leave thy home and country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be the bride of him that pleases,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be his faithful life-companion?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He that comes upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing in a magic vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Having sailed the bay of Lempo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is the good, old Wainamoinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his ship are countless treasures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Richest presents from Wainola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He that rides here in his snow-sledge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his sledge of magic beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the cuckoos and the bluebirds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cometh hither empty-handed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only brings some wisdom-sayings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they come within the dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring a bowl of honeyed viands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring a pitcher with two handles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give to him that thou wouldst follow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give it to old Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him that brings thee countless treasures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Costly presents in his vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Priceless gems from Kalevala.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the Northland’s lovely daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the language of the maiden:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good, indeed, advice maternal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I will not wed for riches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wed no man for countless treasures;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his worth I’ll choose a husband,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his youth and fine appearance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his noble form and features;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the olden times the maidens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were not sold by anxious mothers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the suitors that they loved not.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall choose without his treasures</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen for his wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his worth and good behavior,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him that forged the wondrous Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hammered thee the lid in colors.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Senseless daughter, child of folly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to choose the ancient blacksmith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From whose brow drips perspiration,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evermore to rinse his linen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lave his hands, and eyes, and forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep his ancient house in order;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Little use his wit and wisdom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When compared with gold and silver.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of the daughter:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will never, never, never,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wed the ancient Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his gold and priceless jewels;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never will I be a helpmate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a hero in his dotage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Little thanks my compensation.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, safely landing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In advance of Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pulls his gaily-covered vessel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the waves upon the sea-beach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the cylinders of birch-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the rollers copper-banded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway hastens to the guest-room</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the master of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words upon the threshold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the famous Maid of Beauty:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come with me, thou lovely virgin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be my bride and life-companion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Share with me my joys and sorrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be my honored wife hereafter!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of the maiden:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hast thou built for me the vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built for me the ship of magic</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fragments of the distaff,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the splinters of the spindle?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen thus replying:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have built the promised vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built the wondrous ship for sailing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Firmly joined the parts by magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It will weather roughest billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will outlive the winds and waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swiftly glide upon the blue-back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the deep and boundless ocean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It will ride the waves in beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like an airy bubble rising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a cork on lake and river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the angry seas of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through Pohyola’s peaceful waters.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Northland’s fair and slender daughter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives this answer to her suitor:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Will not wed a sea-born hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not care to rock the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot live with such a husband;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Storms would bring us pain and trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Winds would rack our hearts and temples;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore thee I cannot follow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot keep thy home in order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot be thy life-companion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot wed old Wainamoinen.”</span>
