				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Passed his years in full contentment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the meadows of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the plains of Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing ever wondrous legends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Songs of ancient wit and wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chanting one day, then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing in the dusk of evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing till the dawn of morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the tales of old-time heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tales of ages long forgotten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the legends of creation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once familiar to the children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By our children sung no longer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sung in part by many heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these mournful days of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evil days our race befallen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far and wide the story travelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far away men spread the knowledge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the chanting of the hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the song of Wainamoinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the South were heard the echoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All of Northland heard the story.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Far away in dismal Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lived the singer, Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lapland’s young and reckless minstrel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once upon a time when feasting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dining with his friends and fellows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came upon his ears the story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That there lived a sweeter singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the meadows of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the plains of Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better skilled in chanting legends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better skilled than Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better than the one that taught him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Straightway then the bard grew angry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Envy rose within his bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Envy of this Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Famed to be a sweeter singer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastes he angry to his mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his mother, full of wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vows that he will southward hasten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hie him southward and betake him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dwellings of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cabins of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There as bard to vie in battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the famous Wainamoinen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nay,” replies the anxious father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do not go to Kalevala.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nay,” replies the fearful mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Go not hence to Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There with him to offer battle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will charm thee with his singing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will bewitch thee in his anger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will drive thee back dishonored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sink thee in the fatal snow-drift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn to ice thy pliant fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn to ice thy feet and ankles.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Youkahainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good the judgement of a father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better still, a mother’s counsel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Best of all one’s own decision.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will go and face the minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Challenge him to sing in contest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Challenge him as bard to battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing to him my sweet-toned measures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chant to him my oldest legends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chant to him my garnered wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That this best of boasted singers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That this famous bard of Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall be worsted in the contest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall become a hapless minstrel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By my songs shall I transform him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his feet shall be as flint-stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as oak his nether raiment;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this famous, best of singers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus bewitched, shall carry ever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his heart a stony burden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his shoulder bow of marble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his hand a flint-stone gauntlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his brow a stony visor.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the wizard, Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heeding not advice paternal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heeding not his mother’s counsel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leads his courser from his stable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire outstreaming from his nostrils,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his hoofs, the sparks outshooting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hitches to his sledge, the fleet-foot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his golden sledge, the courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mounts impetuous his snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaps upon the hindmost cross-bench,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes his courser with his birch-whip,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his birch-whip, pearl-enamelled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instantly the prancing racer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Springs away upon his journey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On he, restless, plunges northward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All day long he onward gallops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the next day, onward, onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the third from morn till evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the third day twilight brings him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the meadows of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the plains of Kalevala.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As it happened, Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen, the magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode that sunset on the highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silently for pleasure driving</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down Wainola’s peaceful meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the plains of Kalevala.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Youkahainen, young and fiery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Urging still his foaming courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dashes down upon the singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not turn aside in meeting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meeting thus in full collision;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shafts are driven tight together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hames and collars wedged and tangled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tangled are the reins and traces.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus perforce they make a stand-still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus remain and well consider;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Water drips from hame and collar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vapors rise from both their horses.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks the minstrel, Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who art thou, and whence? Thou comest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Driving like a stupid stripling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Careless, dashing down upon me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast ruined shafts and traces;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the collar of my racer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast shattered into ruin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my golden sleigh is broken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Box and runners dashed to pieces.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Youkahainen then make answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake at last the words that follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I am youthful Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But make answer first, who thou art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence thou comest, where thou goest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From what lowly tribe descended?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answered thus the youthful minstrel:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If thou art but Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shouldst give me all the highway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am many years thy senior.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the boastful Youkahainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake again to Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Young or ancient, little matter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Little consequence the age is;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He that higher stands in wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He whose knowledge is the greater,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He that is the sweeter singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He alone shall keep the highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the other take the roadside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art thou ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Famous sorcerer and minstrel?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us then begin our singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us sing our ancient legends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us chant our garnered wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the one may hear the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the one may judge the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a war of wizard sayings.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, wise and ancient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus replied in modest accents:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What I know is very little,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hardly is it worth the singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither is my singing wondrous:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my days I have resided</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the cold and dreary Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a desert land enchanted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my cottage home for ages;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the songs that I have gathered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are the cuckoo’s simple measures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some of these I may remember;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since thou perforce demandest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I accept thy boastful challenge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me now, my golden youngster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What thou knowest more than others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Open now thy store of wisdom.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus made answer Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lapland’s young and fiery minstrel:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Know I many bits of learning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This I know in perfect clearness:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every roof must have a chimney,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every fireplace have a hearthstone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lives of seal are free and merry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Merry is the life of walrus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feeding on incautious salmon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Daily eating perch and whiting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whitings live in quiet shallows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Salmon love the level bottoms;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spawns the pike in coldest weather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And defies the storms of winter.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Slowly perches swim in Autumn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wry-backed, hunting deeper water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spawn in shallows in the summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bounding on the shore of ocean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should this wisdom seem too little,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can tell thee other matters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing thee other wizard sayings:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the Northmen plow with reindeer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mother-horses plow the Southland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inner Lapland plows with oxen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the trees on Pisa-mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know I well in all their grandeur;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the Horna-rock are fir-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fir-trees growing tall and slender;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slender grow the trees on mountains.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three, the waterfalls in number,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three in number, inland oceans,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three in number, lofty mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shooting to the vault of heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hallapyora’s near to Yaemen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Katrakoski in Karyala;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Imatra, the falling water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tumbles, roaring, into Wuoksi.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the ancient Wainimoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Women’s tales and children’s wisdom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not please a bearded hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hero, old enough for wedlock;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell the story of creation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me of the world’s beginning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me of the creatures in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And philosophize a little.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the youthful Youkahainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus replied to Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Know I well the titmouse-fountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pretty birdling is the titmouse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the viper, green, a serpent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whitings live in brackish waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perches swim in every river;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Iron rusts, and rusting weakens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bitter is the taste of umber;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boiling water is malicious;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire is ever full of danger;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First physician, the Creator;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remedy the oldest, water;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Magic is the child of sea-foam;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God the first and best adviser;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waters gush from every mountain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire descended first from heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Iron from the rust was fashioned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Copper from the rocks created;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marshes are of lands the oldest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First of all the trees, the willow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fir-trees were the first of houses;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hollowed stones the first of kettles.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the ancient Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addresses Youkahainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Canst thou give me now some wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is this nonsense all thou knowest?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Youkahainen thus made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I can tell thee still a trifle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell thee of the times primeval,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I plowed the salt-sea’s bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I raked the sea-girt islands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I dug the salmon-grottoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hollowed out the deepest caverns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I all the lakes created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I heaped the mountains round them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I piled the rocks about them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I was present as a hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sixth of wise and ancient heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seventh of all primeval heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the heavens were created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When were formed the ether-spaces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the sky was crystal-pillared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When was arched the beauteous rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the Moon was placed in orbit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the silver Sun was planted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the Bear was firmly stationed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with stars the heavens were sprinkled.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou art surely prince of liars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lord of all the host of liars;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never wert thou in existence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely wert thou never present,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When was plowed the salt-sea’s bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When were raked the sea-girt islands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When were dug the salmon-grottoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When were hollowed out the caverns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the lakes were all created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When were heaped the mountains round them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the rocks were piled about them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wert never seen or heard of</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the earth was first created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When were made the ether-spaces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the air was crystal-pillared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the Moon was placed in orbit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the silver Sun was planted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the Bear was firmly stationed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the skies with stars were sprinkled.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then in anger Youkahainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answered ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then, sir, since I fail in wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the sword I offer battle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come thou, famous bard and minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou the ancient wonder-singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us try our strength with broadswords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let our blades be fully tested.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not thy sword and not thy wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not thy prudence, nor thy cunning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do I fear a single moment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let who may accept thy challenge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not with thee, a puny braggart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not with one so vain and paltry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will I ever measure broadswords.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the youthful Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mouth awry and visage sneering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shook his golden locks and answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whoso fears his blade to measure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fears to test his strength at broadswords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into wild-boar of the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swine at heart and swine in visage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing I will thus transform him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will hurl such hero-cowards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This one hither, that one thither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stamp him in the mire and bedding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the rubbish of the stable.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Angry then grew Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrathful waxed, and fiercely frowning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Self-composed he broke his silence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And began his wondrous singing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang he not the tales of childhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Children’s nonsense, wit of women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang he rather bearded heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the children never heard of,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the boys and maidens knew not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Known but half by bride and bridegroom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Known in part by many heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these mournful days of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evil times our race befallen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grandly sang wise Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the copper-bearing mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the flinty rocks and ledges</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard his magic tones and trembled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mountain cliffs were torn to pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the ocean heaved and tumbled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the distant hills re-echoed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! the boastful Youkahainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is transfixed in silent wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his sledge with golden trimmings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Floats like brushwood on the billows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings his braces into reed-grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings his reins to twigs of willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to shrubs his golden cross-bench.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! his birch-whip, pearl-enameled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Floats a reed upon the border;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! his steed with golden forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stands a statue on the waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hames and traces are as fir-boughs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his collar, straw and sea-grass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still the minstrel sings enchantment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings his sword with golden handle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings it into gleam of lightning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hangs it in the sky above him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings his crossbow, gaily painted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a rainbow o’er the ocean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings his quick and feathered arrows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into hawks and screaming eagles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings his dog with bended muzzle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into block of stone beside him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings his cap from off his forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings it into wreaths of vapor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his hands he sings his gauntlets</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into rushes on the waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings his vesture, purple-colored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into white clouds in the heavens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings his girdle, set with jewels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into twinkling stars around him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And alas! for Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings him into deeps of quicksand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever deeper, deeper, deeper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his torture, sinks the wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his belt in mud and water.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now it was that Youkahainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comprehended but too clearly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What his folly, what the end was,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the journey he had ventured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vainly he had undertaken</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the glory of a contest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the grand, old Wainamoinen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When at last young Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pohyola’s old and sorry stripling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strives his best to move his right foot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But alas! the foot obeys not;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he strives to move his left foot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! he finds it turned to flint-stone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon sad Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the deeps of desperation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in earnest supplication,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addresses Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou wise and worthy minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou the only true magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cease I pray thee thine enchantment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only turn away thy magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me leave this slough of horror,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loose me from this stony prison,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Free me from this killing torment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will pay a golden ransom.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What the ransom thou wilt give me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I cease from mine enchantment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I turn away my magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lift thee from thy slough of horror,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loose thee from thy stony prison,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Free thee from thy killing torment?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answered youthful Youkahainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have at home two magic crossbows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pair of bows of wondrous power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One so light a child can bend it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only strength can bend the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take of these the one that pleases.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do not wish thy magic crossbows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have a few of such already,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine to me are worse than useless;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have bows in great abundance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bows on every nail and rafter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bows that laugh at all the hunters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bows that go themselves a-hunting.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the ancient Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang alas! poor Youkahainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeper into mud and water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeper in the slough of torment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Youkahainen thus made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have at home two magic shallops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful the boats and wondrous;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One rides light upon the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One is made for heavy burdens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take of these the one that pleases.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do not wish thy magic shallops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have enough of such already;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my bays are full of shallops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my shores are lined with shallops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some before the winds are sailors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some were built to sail against them.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still the Wainola bard and minstrel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings again poor Youkahainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeper, deeper into torment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into quicksand to his girdle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the Lapland bard in anguish</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks again to Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have at home two magic stallions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One a racer, fleet as lightning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One was born for heavy burdens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take of these the one that pleases.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Neither do I wish thy stallions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not need thy hawk-limbed stallions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have enough of these already;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Magic stallions swarm my stables,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eating corn at every manger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broad of back to hold the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Water on each croup in lakelets.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still the bard of Kalevala</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings the hapless Lapland minstrel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeper, deeper into torment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his shoulders into water.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake again young Youkahainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou the only true magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cease I pray thee thine enchantment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only turn away thy magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will give thee gold abundant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Countless stores of shining silver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the wars my father brought it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought it from the hard-fought battles.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the wise, old Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For thy gold I have no longing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither do I wish thy silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have enough of each already;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gold abundant fills my chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On each nail hang bags of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gold that glitters in the sunshine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silver shining in the moonlight.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sank the braggart, Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeper in his slough of torment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his chin in mud and water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever praying, thus beseeching:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Greatest of the old magicians,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lift me from this pit of horror,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From this prison-house of torture;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will give thee all my corn-fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give thee all my corn in garners,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus my hapless life to ransom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to gain eternal freedom.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen thus made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Take thy corn to other markets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give thy garners to the needy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have corn in great abundance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fields have I in every quarter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Corn in all my fields is growing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One’s own fields are always richer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One’s own grain is much the sweeter.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lapland’s young and reckless minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sorrow-laden, thus enchanted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeper sinks in mud and water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fear-enchained and full of anguish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mire, his beard bedrabbled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mouth once boastful filled with sea-weed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the grass his teeth entangled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Youkahainen thus beseeches:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wisest of the wisdom-singers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cease at last thine incantations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only turn away thy magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my former life restore me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lift me from this stifling torment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Free mine eyes from sand and water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will give thee sister, Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest daughter of my mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bride of thine to be forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bride of thine to do thy pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweep the rooms within thy cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep thy dwelling-place in order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rinse for thee the golden platters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread thy couch with finest linens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thy bed, weave golden covers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bake for thee the honey-biscuit.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds at last the wished-for ransom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lapland’s young and fairest daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sister dear of Youkahainen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Happy he, that he has won him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his age a beauteous maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bride of his to be forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pride and joy of Kalevala.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the happy Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sits upon the rock of gladness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joyful on the rock of music,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings a little, sings and ceases,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings again, and sings a third time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to break the spell of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to lessen the enchantment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the potent charm to banish.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the magic spell is broken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Youkahainen, sad, but wiser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drags his feet from out the quicksand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifts his beard from out the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the rocks leads forth his courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings his sledge back from the rushes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calls his whip back from the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sets his golden sledge in order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throws himself upon the cross-bench,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snaps his whip and hies him homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens homeward, heavy-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sad indeed to meet his mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aino’s mother, gray and aged.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Careless thus he hastens homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nears his home with noise and bustle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reckless drives against the penthouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks the shafts against the portals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks his handsome sledge in pieces.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then his mother, quickly guessing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would have chided him for rashness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the father interrupted:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wherefore dost thou break thy snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherefore dash thy thills in fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherefore comest home so strangely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why this rude and wild behavior?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now alas! poor Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cap awry upon his forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls to weeping, broken-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Head depressed and mind dejected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eyes and lips expressing sadness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answers not his anxious father.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the mother quickly asked him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought to find his cause for sorrow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tell me, first-born, why thou weepest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why thou weepest, heavy-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why thy mind is so dejected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why thine eyes express such sadness.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Youkahainen then made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Golden mother, ever faithful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cause there is to me sufficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cause enough in what has happened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bitter cause for this my sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cause for bitter tears and murmurs:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my days will pass unhappy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since, O mother of my being,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have promised beauteous Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aino, thy beloved daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aino, my devoted sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To decrepit Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bride to be to him forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roof above him, prop beneath him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair companion at his fireside.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Joyful then arose the mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clapped her hands in glee together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressing Youkahainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Weep no more, my son beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast naught to cause thy weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast no reason for thy sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often I this hope have cherished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many years have I been praying</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That this mighty bard and hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wise and valiant Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spouse should be to beauteous Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Son-in-law to me, her mother.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the fair and lovely maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sister dear of Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway fell to bitter weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the threshold wept and lingered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept all day and all the night long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept a second, then a third day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept because a bitter sorrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her youthful heart had fallen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the gray-haired mother asked her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why this weeping, lovely Aino?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast found a noble suitor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wilt rule his spacious dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At his window sit and rest thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rinse betimes his golden platters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walk a queen within his dwelling.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus replied the tearful Aino:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mother dear, and all-forgiving,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cause enough for this my sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cause enough for bitter weeping:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must loose my sunny tresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tresses beautiful and golden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot deck my hair with jewels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot bind my head with ribbons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All to be hereafter hidden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Underneath the linen bonnet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the wife must wear forever;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep at morning, weep at evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep alas! for waning beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Childhood vanished, youth departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silver sunshine, golden moonlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hope and pleasure of my childhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taken from me now forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so soon to be forgotten</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the tool-bench of my brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the window of my sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the cottage of my father.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake again the gray-haired mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To her wailing daughter Aino:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Cease thy sorrow, foolish maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By thy tears thou art ungrateful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reason none for thy repining,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the slightest cause for weeping;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everywhere the silver sunshine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls as bright on other households;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not alone the moonlight glimmers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through thy father’s open windows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the work-bench of thy brother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flowers bloom in every meadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Berries grow on every mountain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst go thyself and find them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the day long go and find them;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not alone thy brother’s meadows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grow the beauteous vines and flowers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not alone thy father’s mountains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yield the ripe, nutritious berries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flowers bloom in other meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Berries grow on other mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There as here, my lovely Aino.”</span>
