			<p>
				<span>Pohyola’s fair and winsome daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glory of the land and water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat upon the bow of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On its highest arch resplendent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a gown of richest fabric,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a gold and silver air-gown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weaving webs of golden texture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Interlacing threads of silver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weaving with a golden shuttle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a weaving-comb of silver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Merrily flies the golden shuttle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the maiden’s nimble fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Briskly swings the lathe in weaving,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swiftly flies the comb of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the sky-born maiden’s fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weaving webs of wondrous beauty.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Came the ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Driving down the highway homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the ever sunless Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the dismal Sariola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Few the furlongs he had driven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Driven but a little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he heard the sky-loom buzzing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the maiden plied the shuttle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the thoughtless Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifts his eyes aloft in wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looks upon the vault of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There beholds the bow of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the bow the maiden sitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beauteous Maiden of the Rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glory of the earth and ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weaving there a golden fabric,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Working with the rustling silver.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly checks his fleet-foot racer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looks upon the charming maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then addresses her as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come, fair maiden, to my snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By my side I wish thee seated.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus the Maid of Beauty answers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tell me what thou wishest of me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should I join thee in the snow-sledge.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks the ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answers thus the Maid of Beauty:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This the reason for thy coming:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt bake me honey-biscuit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shalt prepare me barley-water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt fill my foaming beer-cups,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt sing beside my table,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shalt rejoice within my portals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walk a queen within my dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Wainola halls and chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the courts of Kalevala.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus the Maid of Beauty answered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From her throne amid the heavens:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yesterday at hour of twilight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went I to the flowery meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to rock upon the common,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the Sun retires to slumber;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There I heard a song-bird singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the thrush in simple measures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing sweetly thoughts of maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the minds of anxious mothers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then I asked the pretty songster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked the thrush this simple question:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Sing to me, thou pretty song-bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing that I may understand thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing to me in truthful accents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to live in greatest pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in happiness the sweetest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a maiden with her father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or as wife beside her husband.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thus the song-bird gave me answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the thrush this information:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Bright and warm are days of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Warmer still is maiden-freedom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cold is iron in the winter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the lives of married women;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maidens living with their mothers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are like ripe and ruddy berries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Married women, far too many,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are like dogs enchained in kennel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rarely do they ask for favors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to wives are favors given.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answers thus the Maid of Beauty:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Foolish is the thrush thus singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nonsense is the song-bird’s twitter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like to babes are maidens treated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wives are queens and highly honored.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, sweet maiden, to my snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am not despised as hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the meanest of magicians;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come with me and I will make thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wife and queen in Kalevala.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the Maid of Beauty answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Would consider thee a hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mighty hero, I would call thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a golden hair thou splittest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Using knives that have no edges;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thou snarest me a bird’s egg</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a snare that I can see not.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, skilled and ancient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Split a golden hair exactly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Using knives that had no edges;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he snared an egg as nicely</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a snare the maiden saw not.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Come, sweet maiden, to my snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have done what thou desirest.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the maiden wisely answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Never enter I thy snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till thou peelest me the sandstone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till thou cuttest me a whip-stick</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the ice, and make no splinters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Losing not the smallest fragment.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, true magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing daunted, not discouraged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deftly peeled the rounded sandstone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deftly cut from ice a whip-stick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cutting not the finest splinter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Losing not the smallest fragment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then again he called the maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a seat within his snow-sledge.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the Maid or Beauty answered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answered thus the great magician:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will go with that one only</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will make me ship or shallop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the splinters of my spindle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fragments of my distaff,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the waters launch the vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set the little ship a-floating,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Using not the knee to push it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Using not the arm to move it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Using not the hand to touch it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Using not the foot to turn it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Using nothing to propel it.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the skilful Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words the hero uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There is no one in the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one under vault of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who like me can build a vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fragments of the distaff,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the splinters of the spindle.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he took the distaff-fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took the splinters of the spindle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened off the boat to fashion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to an iron mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to join the many fragments.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of zeal he plies the hammer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swings the hammer and the hatchet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing daunted, builds the vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Works one day and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Works with steady hand the third day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the evening of the third day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evil Hisi grasps the hatchet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lempo takes the crooked handle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turns aside the axe in falling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes the rocks and breaks to pieces;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the rocks rebound the fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pierce the flesh of the magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut the knee of Wainamoinen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lempo guides the sharpened hatchet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the veins fell Hisi severs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly gushes forth a blood-stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the stream is crimson-colored.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The renowned and wise enchanter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus outspeaks in measured accents:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou keen and cruel hatchet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O thou axe of sharpened metal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shouldst cut the trees to fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut the pine-tree and the willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut the alder and the birch-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut the juniper and aspen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst not cut my knee to pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst not tear my veins asunder.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the ancient Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus begins his incantations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus begins his magic singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the origin of evil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every word in perfect order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes no effort to remember,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings the origin of iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That a bolt he well may fashion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus prepare a lock for surety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the wounds the axe has given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the hatchet has torn open.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the stream flows like a brooklet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rushing like a maddened torrent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stains the herbs upon the meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarcely is a bit of verdure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the blood-stream does not cover</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As it flows and rushes onward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the knee of the magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the veins of Wainamoinen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the wise and ancient minstrel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathers lichens from the sandstone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Picks them from the trunks of birches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathers moss within the marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pulls the grasses from the meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to stop the crimson streamlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to close the wounds laid open;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But his work is unsuccessful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the crimson stream flows onward.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feeling pain and fearing languor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls to weeping, heavy-hearted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly now his steed he hitches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hitches to the sledge of birch-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Climbs with pain upon the cross-bench,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes his steed in quick succession,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snaps his whip above the racer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the steed flies onward swiftly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the winds he sweeps the highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he nears a Northland village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the way is triple-parted.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, old and truthful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the lowest of the highways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly nears a spacious cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly asks before the doorway:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is there any one here dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can know the pain I suffer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can heal this wound of hatchet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can check this crimson streamlet?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sat a boy within a corner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a bench beside a baby,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he answered thus the hero:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There is no one in this dwelling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can know the pain thou feelest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can heal the wounds of hatchet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can check the crimson streamlet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some one lives in yonder cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That perchance can do thee service.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whips his courser to a gallop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dashes on along the highway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only drives a little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the middle of the highways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a cabin on the roadside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asks one standing on the threshold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Questions all through open windows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words the hero uses:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is there no one in this cabin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can know the pain I suffer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can heal this wound of hatchet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can check this crimson streamlet?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the floor a witch was lying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the fireplace lay the beldame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus she spake to Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through her rattling teeth she answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There is no one in this cabin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can know the pain thou feelest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can heal the wounds of hatchets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can check the crimson streamlet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some one lives in yonder cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That perchance can do thee service.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, nothing daunted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whips his racer to a gallop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dashes on along the highway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only drives a little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the upper of the highways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gallops to a humble cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asks one standing near the penthouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting on the penthouse-doorsill:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is there no one in this cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can know the pain I suffer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can heal this wound of hatchet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can check this crimson streamlet?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Near the fireplace sat an old man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the hearthstone sat the gray-beard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus he answered Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Greater things have been accomplished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much more wondrous things effected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through but three words of the master;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the telling of the causes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streams and oceans have been tempered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>River cataracts been lessened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bays been made of promontories,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Islands raised from deep sea-bottoms.”</span>
