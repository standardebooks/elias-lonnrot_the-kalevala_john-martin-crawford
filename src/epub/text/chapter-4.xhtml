			<p>
				<span>When the night had passed, the maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sister fair of Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened early to the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Birchen shoots for brooms to gather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went to gather birchen tassels;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound a bundle for her father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound a birch-broom for her mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silken tassels for her sister.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway then she hastened homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By a footpath left the forest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As she neared the woodland border,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! the ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly spying out the maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As she left the birchen woodland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trimly dressed in costly raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the minstrel thus addressed her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Aino, beauty of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wear not, lovely maid, for others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only wear for me, sweet maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden cross upon thy bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shining pearls upon thy shoulders;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bind for me thine auburn tresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wear for me thy golden braidlets.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the maiden quickly answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not for thee and not for others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hang I from my neck the crosslet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deck my hair with silken ribbons;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Need no more the many trinkets</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought to me by ship or shallop;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sooner wear the simplest raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed upon the barley bread-crust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dwell forever with my mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the cabin with my father.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then she threw the gold cross from her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tore the jewels from her fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly loosed her shining necklace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick untied her silken ribbons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast them all away indignant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into forest ferns and flowers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon the maiden, Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to her mother’s cottage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At the window sat her father</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whittling on an oaken ax-helve:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wherefore weepest, beauteous Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aino, my beloved daughter?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Cause enough for weeping, father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good the reasons for my mourning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This, the reason for my weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This, the cause of all my sorrow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my breast I tore the crosslet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my belt, the clasp of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my waist, the belt of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden was my pretty crosslet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Near the doorway sat her brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carving out a birchen ox-bow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why art weeping, lovely Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aino, my devoted sister?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Cause enough for weeping, brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good the reasons for my mourning:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore come I as thou seest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rings no longer on my fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On my neck no pretty necklace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden were the rings thou gavest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the necklace, pearls and silver!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the threshold sat her sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weaving her a golden girdle:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why art weeping, beauteous Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aino, my beloved sister?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Cause enough for weeping, sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good the reasons for my sorrow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore come I as thou seest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On my head no scarlet fillet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my hair no braids of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On mine arms no purple ribbons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round my neck no shining necklace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On my breast no golden crosslet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In mine ears no golden ear-rings.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Near the doorway of the dairy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skimming cream, sat Aino’s mother.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why art weeping, lovely Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aino, my devoted daughter?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the sobbing maiden answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Loving mother, all-forgiving,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cause enough for this my weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good the reasons for my sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore do I weep, dear mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have been within the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brooms to bind and shoots to gather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to pluck some birchen tassels;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound a bundle for my father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound a second for my mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound a third one for my brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For my sister silken tassels.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway then I hastened homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By a footpath left the forest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I reached the woodland border</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake Osmoinen from the cornfield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Wear not, beauteous maid, for others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only wear for me, sweet maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On thy breast a golden crosslet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shining pearls upon thy shoulders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bind for me thine auburn tresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weave for me thy silver braidlets.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I threw the gold-cross from me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tore the jewels from my fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly loosed my shining necklace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick untied my silken ribbons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast them all away indignant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into forest ferns and flowers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I thus addressed the singer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Not for thee and not for others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hang I from my neck the crosslet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deck my hair with silken ribbons;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Need no more the many trinkets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought to me by ship and shallop;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sooner wear the simplest raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed upon the barley bread-crust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dwell forever with my mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the cabin with my father.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus the gray-haired mother answered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aino, her beloved daughter:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Weep no more, my lovely maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waste no more of thy sweet young-life;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One year eat thou my sweet butter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It will make thee strong and ruddy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eat another year fresh bacon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It will make thee tall and queenly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eat a third year only dainties,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It will make thee fair and lovely.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now make haste to yonder hill-top,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the storehouse on the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Open there the large compartment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou will find it filled with boxes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chests and cases, trunks and boxes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Open thou the box, the largest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lift away the gaudy cover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou will find six golden girdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seven rainbow-tinted dresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woven by the Moon’s fair daughters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fashioned by the Sun’s sweet virgins.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my young years once I wandered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a maiden on the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the happy days of childhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hunting berries in the coppice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There by chance I heard the daughters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Moon as they were weaving;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There I also heard the daughters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Sun as they were spinning</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the red rims of the cloudlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the blue edge of the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the border of the pine-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a high and distant mountain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I approached them, drawing nearer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stole myself within their hearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then began I to entreat them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus besought them, gently pleading:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Give thy silver, Moon’s fair daughters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a poor, but worthy maiden;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give thy gold, O Sun’s sweet virgins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To this maiden, young and needy.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon the Moon’s fair daughters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave me silver from their coffers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Sun’s sweet shining virgins</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave me gold from their abundance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gold to deck my throbbing temples,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For my hair the shining silver.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I hastened joyful homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Richly laden with my treasures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Happy to my mother’s cottage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wore them one day, then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then a third day also wore them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took the gold then from my temples,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my hair I took the silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Careful laid them in their boxes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many seasons have they lain there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have not seen them since my childhood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deck thy brow with silken ribbon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trim with gold thy throbbing temples,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thy neck with pearly necklace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hang the gold-cross on thy bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Robe thyself in pure, white linen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spun from flax of finest fiber;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wear withal the richest short-frock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fasten it with golden girdle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On thy feet, put silken stockings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the shoes of finest leather;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deck thy hair with golden braidlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bind it well with threads of silver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trim with rings thy fairy fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thy hands with dainty ruffles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come bedecked then to thy chamber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus return to this thy household,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the greeting of thy kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the joy of all that know thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flushed thy cheeks as ruddy berries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coming as thy father’s sunbeam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walking beautiful and queenly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far more beautiful than moonlight.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus she spake to weeping Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the mother to her daughter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the maiden, little hearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not heed her mother’s wishes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway hastens to the court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to weep in bitter sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All alone to weep in anguish.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Waiting long the wailing Aino</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus at last soliloquizes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Unto what can I now liken</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Happy homes and joys of fortune?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the waters in the river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the waves in yonder lakelet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the crystal waters flowing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto what, the biting sorrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the child of cold misfortune?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the spirit of the sea-duck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the icicle in winter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Water in the well imprisoned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often roamed my mind in childhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a maiden free and merry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Happily through fen and fallow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gamboled on the meads with lambkins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lingered with the ferns and flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knowing neither pain nor trouble;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now my mind is filled with sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanders through the bog and stubble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanders weary through the brambles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roams throughout the dismal forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till my life is filled with darkness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my spirit white with anguish.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better had it been for Aino</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had she never seen the sunlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or if born had died an infant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had not lived to be a maiden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these days of sin and sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Underneath a star so luckless.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better had it been for Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had she died upon the eighth day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After seven nights had vanished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Needed then but little linen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Needed but a little coffin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a grave of smallest measure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mother would have mourned a little,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Father too perhaps a trifle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sister would have wept the day through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brother might have shed a tear-drop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus had ended all the mourning.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus poor Aino wept and murmured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept one day, and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept a third from morn till even,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When again her mother asked her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why this weeping, fairest daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Darling daughter, why this grieving?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the tearful maiden answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Therefore do I weep and sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wretched maiden all my life long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since poor Aino, thou hast given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since thy daughter thou hast promised</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the aged Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comfort to his years declining,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prop to stay him when he totters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the storm a roof above him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his home a cloak around him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better far if thou hadst sent me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far below the salt-sea surges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To become the whiting’s sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the friend of perch and salmon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better far to ride the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swim the sea-foam as a mermaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the friend of nimble fishes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than to be an old man’s solace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prop to stay him when he totters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hand to aid him when he trembles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arm to guide him when he falters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strength to give him when he weakens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better be the whiting’s sister</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the friend of perch and salmon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than an old man’s slave and darling.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ending thus she left her mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway hastened to the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the storehouse on the summit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Opened there the box the largest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the box six lids she lifted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found therein six golden girdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silken dresses seven in number.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Choosing such as pleased her fancy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She adorned herself as bidden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Robed herself to look her fairest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gold upon her throbbing temples,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her hair the shining silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her shoulders purple ribbons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Band of blue around her forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden cross, and rings, and jewels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fitting ornaments to beauty.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now she leaves her many treasures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaves the storehouse on the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled with gold and silver trinkets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanders over field and meadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over stone-fields waste and barren,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanders on through fen and forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the forest vast and cheerless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanders hither, wanders thither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing careless as she wanders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This her mournful song and echo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Woe is me, my life hard-fated!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woe to Aino, broken-hearted!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Torture racks my heart and temples,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet the sting would not be deeper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the pain and anguish greater,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If beneath this weight of sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my saddened heart’s dejection,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should yield my life forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now unhappy, I should perish!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! the time has come for Aino</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From this cruel world to hasten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the kingdom of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the realm of the departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the isle of the hereafter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weep no more for me, O Father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mother dear, withhold thy censure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lovely sister, dry thine eyelids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not mourn me, dearest brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I sink beneath the sea-foam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make my home in salmon-grottoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make my bed in crystal waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Water-ferns my couch and pillow.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All day long poor Aino wandered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the next day, sad and weary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the third from morn till evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the cruel night enwrapped her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As she reached the sandy margin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reached the cold and dismal sea-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat upon the rock of sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat alone in cold and darkness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Listened only to the music</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the winds and rolling billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing all the dirge of Aino.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All that night the weary maiden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept and wandered on the border</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the sand and sea-washed pebbles.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the day dawns, looking round her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She beholds three water-maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a headland jutting seaward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Water-maidens four in number,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting on the wave-lashed ledges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swimming now upon the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now upon the rocks reposing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the weeping maiden, Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens there to join the mermaids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairy maidens of the waters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeping Aino, now disrobing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lays aside with care her garments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hangs her silk robes on the alders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drops her gold-cross on the sea-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the aspen hangs her ribbons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the rocks her silken stockings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the grass her shoes of deer-skin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sand her shining necklace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her rings and other jewels.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Out at sea a goodly distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood a rock of rainbow colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glittering in silver sunlight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward it springs the hapless maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thither swims the lovely Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up the standing-stone has clambered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wishing there to rest a moment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rest upon the rock of beauty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When upon a sudden swaying</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To and fro among the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a crash and roar of waters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls the stone of many colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls upon the very bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the stone of rainbow colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls the weeping maiden, Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clinging to its craggy edges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sinking far below the surface,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bottom of the blue-sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the weeping maiden vanished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus poor Aino sank and perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing as the stone descended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chanting thus as she departed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Once to swim I sought the seaside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to sport among the billows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the stone of many colors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sank poor Aino to the bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a pretty song-bird perished.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never come a-fishing, father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the borders of these waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never during all thy lifetime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou lovest daughter Aino.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Mother dear, I sought the seaside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to sport among the billows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the stone of many colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sank poor Aino to the bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a pretty song-bird perished.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never mix thy bread, dear mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the blue-sea’s foam and waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never during all thy lifetime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou lovest daughter Aino.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Brother dear, I sought the seaside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to sport among the billows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the stone of many colors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sank poor Aino to the bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a pretty song-bird perished.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never bring thy prancing war-horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never bring thy royal racer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never bring thy steeds to water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the borders of the blue-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never during all thy lifetime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou lovest sister Aino.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sister dear, I sought the seaside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to sport among the billows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the stone of many colors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sank poor Aino to the bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a pretty song-bird perished.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never come to lave thine eyelids</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this rolling wave and sea-foam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never during all thy lifetime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou lovest sister Aino.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the waters in the blue-sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall be blood of Aino’s body;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the fish that swim these waters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall be Aino’s flesh forever;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the willows on the seaside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall be Aino’s ribs hereafter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the sea-grass on the margin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will have grown from Aino’s tresses.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus at last the maiden vanished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the lovely Aino perished.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will tell the cruel story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will bear the evil tidings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cottage of her mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once the home of lovely Aino?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will the bear repeat the story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell the tidings to her mother?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, the bear must not be herald,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would slay the herds of cattle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who then tell the cruel story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will bear the evil tidings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cottage of her father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once the home of lovely Aino?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall the wolf repeat the story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell the sad news to her father?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, the wolf must not be herald,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would eat the gentle lambkins.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who then tell the cruel story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will bear the evil tidings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cottage of her sister?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will the fox repeat the story</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell the tidings to her sister?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, the fox must not be herald,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would eat the ducks and chickens.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who then tell the cruel story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will bear the evil tidings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cottage of her brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once the home of lovely Aino?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall the hare repeat the story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bear the sad news to her brother?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, the hare shall be the herald,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell to all the cruel story.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the harmless hare makes answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will bear the evil tidings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the former home of Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell the story to her kindred.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Swiftly flew the long-eared herald,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the winds he hastened onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Galloped swift as flight of eagles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neck awry he bounded forward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he gained the wished-for cottage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once the home of lovely Aino.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silent was the home, and vacant;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So he hastened to the bath-house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found therein a group of maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Working each upon a birch-broom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat the hare upon the threshold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the maidens thus addressed him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hie there, Long-legs, or we’ll roast thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hie there, Big-eye, or we’ll stew thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roast thee for our lady’s breakfast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stew thee for our master’s dinner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make of thee a meal for Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And her brother, Youkahainen!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better therefore thou shouldst gallop</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy burrow in the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than be roasted for our dinners.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the haughty hare made answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chanting thus the fate of Aino:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Think ye not I journey hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be roasted in the skillet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be stewed in yonder kettle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let fell Lempo fill thy tables!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have come with evil tidings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to tell the cruel story</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the flight and death of Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sister dear of Youkahainen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the stone of many colors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sank poor Aino to the bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the deep and boundless waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a pretty song-bird perished;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hung her ribbons on the aspen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left her gold-cross on the sea-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silken robes upon the alders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the rocks her silken stockings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the grass her shoes of deer-skin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sand her shining necklace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sand her rings and jewels;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the waves, the lovely Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleeping on the very bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the deep and boundless blue-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the caverns of the salmon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to be the whiting’s sister</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the friend of nimble fishes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sadly weeps the ancient mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From her blue-eyes bitter tear-drops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As in sad and wailing measures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broken-hearted thus she answers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Listen, all ye mothers, listen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Learn from me a tale of wisdom:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never urge unwilling daughters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the dwellings of their fathers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bridegrooms that they love not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not as I, inhuman mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drove away my lovely Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest daughter of the Northland.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sadly weeps the gray-haired mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the tears that fall are bitter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flowing down her wrinkled visage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till they trickle on her bosom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then across her heaving bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till they reach her garment’s border;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then adown her silken stockings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till they touch her shoes of deer-skin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then beneath her shoes of deer-skin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flowing on and flowing ever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Part to earth as its possession,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Part to water as its portion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the tear-drops fall and mingle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Form they streamlets three in number,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And their source, the mother’s eyelids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streamlets formed from pearly tear-drops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flowing on like little rivers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each streamlet larger growing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon becomes a rushing torrent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In each rushing, roaring torrent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There a cataract is foaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foaming in the silver sunlight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the cataract’s commotion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise three pillared rocks in grandeur;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From each rock, upon the summit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grow three hillocks clothed in verdure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From each hillock, speckled birches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three in number, struggle skyward;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the summit of each birch-tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sits a golden cuckoo calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the three sing, all in concord:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Love! O Love!” the first one calleth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings the second, “Suitor! Suitor!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the third one calls and echoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Consolation! Consolation!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He that “Love! O Love!” is calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calls three moons and calls unceasing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the love-rejecting maiden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleeping in the deep sea-castles.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He that “Suitor! Suitor!” singeth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings six moons and sings unceasing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the suitor that forever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings and sues without a hearing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He that sadly sings and echoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Consolation! Consolation!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sings unceasing all his life long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the broken-hearted mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That must mourn and weep forever.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the lone and wretched mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the sacred cuckoo singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake she thus, and sorely weeping:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“When I hear the cuckoo calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then my heart is filled with sorrow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tears unlock my heavy eyelids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flow adown my furrowed visage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tears as large as silver sea pearls;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Older grow my wearied elbows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weaker ply my aged fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wearily, in all its members,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does my body shake in palsy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I hear the cuckoo singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear the sacred cuckoo calling.”</span>
