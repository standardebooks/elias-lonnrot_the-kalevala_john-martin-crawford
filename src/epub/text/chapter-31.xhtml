			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>In the ancient times a mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hatched and raised some swans and chickens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Placed the chickens in the brushwood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Placed her swans upon the river;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came an eagle, hawk, and falcon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scattered all her swans and chickens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One was carried to Karyala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a second into Ehstland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left a third at home in Pohya.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the one to Ehstland taken</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon became a thriving merchant;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He that journeyed to Karyala</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flourished and was called Kalervo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He that hid away in Pohya</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took the name of Untamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flourished to his father’s sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the heart-pain of his mother.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Untamoinen sets his fish-nets</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the waters of Kalervo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen sees the fish-nets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the fish home in his basket.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Untamo, evil-minded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Angry grew and sighed for vengeance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clutched his fingers for the combat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bared his mighty arms for battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the stealing of his salmon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the robbing of his fish-nets.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long they battled, fierce the struggle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither one could prove the victor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should one beat the other fiercely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He himself was fiercely beaten.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then arose a second trouble;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the second and the third days,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kalerwoinen sowed some barley</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the barns of Untamoinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untamoinen’s sheep in hunger</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ate the crop of Kullerwoinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen’s dog in malice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tore Untamo’s sheep in pieces;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Untamo sorely threatened</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To annihilate the people</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his brother, Kalerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To exterminate his tribe-folk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To destroy the young and aged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To out-root his race and kingdom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conjures men with broadswords girded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the war he fashions heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fashions youth with spears adjusted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bearing axes on their shoulders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conjures thus a mighty army,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens to begin a battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring a war upon his brother.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kalerwoinen’s wife in beauty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat beside her chamber-window,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looking out along the highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in wonder guessing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do I see some smoke arising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or perchance a heavy storm-cloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the border of the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the ending of the prairie?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was not some smoke arising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor indeed a heavy storm-cloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was Untamoinen’s soldiers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marching to the place of battle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Warriors of Untamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came equipped with spears and arrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Killed the people of Kalervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slew his tribe and all his kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burned to ashes many dwellings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Levelled many courts and cabins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only, left Kalervo’s daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her unborn child, survivors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the slaughter of Untamo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she led the hostile army</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To her father’s halls and mansion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swept the rooms and made them cheery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave the heroes home-attentions.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Time had gone but little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere a boy was born in magic</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the virgin, Untamala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a mother, trouble-laden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him the mother named Kullervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Pearl of Combat,” said Untamo.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then they laid the child of wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fatherless, the magic infant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the cradle of attention,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be rocked, and fed, and guarded;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he rocked himself at pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocked until his locks stood endwise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocked one day, and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocked the third from morn till noontide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But before the third day ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kicks the boy with might of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forwards, backwards, upwards, downwards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kicks in miracles of power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bursts with might his swaddling garments</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Creeping from beneath his blankets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knocks his cradle into fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tears to tatters all his raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seemed that he would grow a hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his mother, Untamala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought that be, when full of stature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he found his strength and reason,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would become a great magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First among a thousand heroes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When three months the boy had thriven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He began to speak as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“When my form is full of stature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When these arms grow strong and hardy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will I avenge the murder</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Kalervo and his people!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Untamoinen hears the saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words to those about him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To my tribe he brings destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In him grows a new Kalervo!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the heroes well considered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the women gave their counsel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to kill the magic infant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That their tribe may live in safety.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It appeared the boy would prosper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finally, they all consenting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was placed within a basket,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with willows firmly fastened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taken to the reeds and rushes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lowered to the deepest waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his basket there to perish.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When three nights had circled over,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Messengers of Untamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went to see if he had perished</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his basket in the waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the prodigy, was living,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had not perished in the rushes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had left his willow-basket,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat in triumph on a billow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his hand a rod of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the rod a golden fish-line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fishing for the silver whiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Measuring the deeps beneath him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sea was little water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarcely would it fill three measures.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Untamoinen then reflected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the language of the wizard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whither shall we take this wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay this prodigy of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That destruction may o’ertake him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the boy will sink and perish?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then his messengers he ordered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To collect dried poles of brushwood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Birch-trees with their hundred branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pine-trees full of pitch and resin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ordered that a pyre be builded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the boy might be cremated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Kullervo thus might perish.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High they piled the arid branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dried limbs from the sacred birch-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Branches from a hundred fir-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knots and branches full of resign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled with bark a thousand sledges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seasoned oak, a hundred measures;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Piled the brushwood to the tree-tops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set the boy upon the summit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set on fire the pile of brushwood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burned one day, and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burned the third from morn till evening.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Untamo sent his heralds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To inspect the pyre and wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to learn if young Kullervo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had been burned to dust and ashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There they saw the young boy sitting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a pyramid of embers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his band a rod of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raking coals of fire about him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To increase their heat and power;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a hair was burned nor injured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a ringlet singed nor shrivelled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Untamo, evil-humored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed his trusted heralds:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whither shall the boy be taken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To what place this thing of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That destruction may o’ertake him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the boy may sink and perish?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then they hung him to an oak-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crucified him in the branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the wizard there might perish.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When three days and nights had ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untamoinen spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“It is time to send my heralds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To inspect the mighty oak-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to learn if young Kullervo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lives or dies among the branches.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon he sent his servants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the heralds brought this message:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Young Kullervo has not perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has not died among the branches</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the oak-tree where we hung him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the oak he maketh pictures</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a wand between his fingers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pictures hang from all the branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carved and painted by Kullervo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the heroes, thick as acorns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their swords and spears adjusted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill the branches of the oak-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every leaf becomes a soldier.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who can help the grave Untamo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kill the boy that threatens evil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Untamo’s tribe and country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since he will not die by water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor by fire, nor crucifixion?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finally it was decided</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his body was immortal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could not suffer death nor torture.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In despair grave Untamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed the boy, Kullervo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wilt thou live a life becoming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always do my people honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should I keep thee in my dwelling?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou render servant’s duty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then thou wilt receive thy wages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reaping whatsoe’er thou sowest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst wear the golden girdle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or endure the tongue of censure.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the boy had grown a little,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had increased in strength and stature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was given occupation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He was made to tend an infant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made to rock the infant’s cradle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Untamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Often look upon the young child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed him well and guard from danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wash his linen in the river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give the infant good attention.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Young Kullervo, wicked wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nurses one day then a second;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the morning of the third day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives the infant cruel treatment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blinds its eyes and breaks its fingers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when evening shadows gather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kills the young child while it slumbers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throws its body to the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks and burns the infant’s cradle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untamoinen thus reflected:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Never will this fell Kullervo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be a worthy nurse for children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot rock a babe in safety;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not know how I can use him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What employment I can give him!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he told the young magician</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He must fell the standing forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Kullervo gave this answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Only will I be a hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I wield the magic hatchet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am young, and fair, and mighty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far more beautiful than others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have the skill of six magicians.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon he sought the blacksmith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the order of Kullervo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Listen, O thou metal-artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge for me an axe of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge the mighty axe of heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewith I may fell the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell the birch, and oak, and aspen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This behest the blacksmith honors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forges him an axe of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wonderful the blade he forges.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen grinds his hatchet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grinds his blade from morn till evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the next day makes the handle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he hastens to the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the upward-sloping mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the tallest of the birches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the mightiest of oak-trees;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There he swings his axe of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swings his blade with might of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cuts with sharpened edge the aspen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With one blow he fells the oak-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a second blow, the linden;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many trees have quickly fallen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the hatchet of Kullervo.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the wizard spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This the proper work of Lempo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let dire Hisi fell the forest!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the birch he sank his hatchet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made an uproar in the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called aloud in tones, of thunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whistled to the distant mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till they echoed to his calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Kullervo spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“May the forest, in the circle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my voice rings, fall and perish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the earth be lost forever!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May no tree remain unlevelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May no saplings grow in spring-time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never while the moonlight glimmers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Kullervo’s voice has echoed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the forest hears my calling;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the ground with seed is planted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the grain shall sprout and flourish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May it never come to ripeness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May the ears of corn be blasted!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the strong man, Untamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went to look at early evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How Kullervo was progressing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his labors in the forest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Little was the work accomplished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not worthy of a hero;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untamoinen thus reflected:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Young Kullervo is not fitted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the work of clearing forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wastes the best of all the timber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my lands he brings destruction;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall set him making fences.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the youth began the building</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a fence for Untamoinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took the trunks of stately fir-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trimmed them with his blade for fence-posts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut the tallest in the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the railing of his fences;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the smaller poles and cross-bars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the longest of the lindens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the fence without a pass-way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made no wicket in his fences,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Kullervo spake these measures.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“He that does not rise as eagles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not sail on wings through ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot cross Kullervo’s pickets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the fences he has builded.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Untamoinen left his mansion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To inspect the young boy’s labors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>View the fences of Kullervo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the fence without a pass-way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a wicket in his fences;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the earth the fence extended</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the highest clouds of heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Untamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For this work he is not fitted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Useless is the fence thus builded;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is so high that none can cross it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there is no passage through it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He shall thresh the rye and barley.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Young Kullervo, quick preparing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made an oaken flail for threshing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threshed the rye to finest powder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threshed the barley into atoms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the straw to worthless fragments.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Untamoinen went at evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went to see Kullervo’s threshing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>View the work of Kullerwoinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found the rye was ground to powder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grains of barley crushed to atoms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the straw to worthless rubbish.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Untamoinen then grew angry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in bitter accents:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Kullerwoinen as a workman</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is a miserable failure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whatsoever work he touches</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is but ruined by his witchcraft;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall carry him to Ehstland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Karyala I shall sell him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to swing the heavy hammer.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Untamoinen sells Kullervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trades him off in far Karyala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the master of the metals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the sum received in payment:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seven worn and worthless sickles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three old caldrons worse than useless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three old scythes, and hoes, and axes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Recompense, indeed, sufficient</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For a boy that will not labor</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the good of his employer.</span>
