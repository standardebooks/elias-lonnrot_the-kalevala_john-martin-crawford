			<p>
				<span>Kullerwoinen, wizard-servant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Purchased slave from Untamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Magic son with sky-blue stockings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a head of golden ringlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his shoes of marten-leather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting little, asked the blacksmith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked the host for work at morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the evening asked the hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Kullerwoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Give me work at early morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the evening, occupation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Labor worthy of thy servant.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the wife of Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once the Maiden of the Rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thinking long, and long debating,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to give the youth employment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the purchased slave could labor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finally a shepherd made him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made him keeper of her pastures;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the over-scornful hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Baked a biscuit for the herdsman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Baked a loaf of wondrous thickness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Baked the lower-half of oat-meal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the upper-half of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Baked a flint-stone in the centre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poured around it liquid butter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then she gave it to the shepherd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Food to still the herdsman’s hunger;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus she gave the youth instructions:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do not eat the bread in hunger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the herd is in the woodlands!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the wife of Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent her cattle to the pasture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressing Kullerwoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Drive the cows to yonder bowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the birch-trees and the aspens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they there may feed and fatten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill themselves with milk and butter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the open forest-pastures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the distant hills and mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the glens among the birch-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the lowlands with the aspens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the golden pine-tree forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the thickets silver-laden.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Guard them, thou O kind Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shield them, omnipresent Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shelter them from every danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And protect them from all evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they may not want, nor wander</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the paths of peace and plenty.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As at home Thou didst protect them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the shelters and the hurdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guard them now beneath the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shelter them in woodland pastures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the herds may live and prosper</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the joy of Northland’s hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And against the will of Lempo.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If my herdsman prove unworthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the shepherd-maids seem evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the pastures be their shepherds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the alders guard the cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the birch-tree their protector,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the willow drive them homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the hostess go to seek them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the milkmaids wait and worry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should the birch-tree not protect them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the aspen lend assistance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the linden be their keeper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the willow drive them homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou give them better herdsmen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let Creation’s beauteous daughters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be their kindly shepherdesses.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast many lovely maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many hundreds that obey thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Ether’s spacious circles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beauteous daughters of creation.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Summer-daughter, magic maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Southern mother of the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pine-tree daughter, Kateyatar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pihlayatar, of the aspen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alder-maiden, Tapio’s daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Daughter of the glen, Millikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the mountain-maid, Tellervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my herds be ye protectors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep them from the evil-minded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep them safe in days of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the times of fragrant flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the tender leaves are whispering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the Earth is verdure-laden.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Summer-daughter, charming maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Southern mother of the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread abroad thy robes of safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread thine apron o’er the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let it cover all my cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And protect the unprotected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That no evil winds may harm them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not suffer from the storm-clouds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guard my flocks from every danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep them from the hands of wild-beasts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the swamps with sinking pathways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the springs that bubble trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the swiftly running waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the bottom of the whirlpool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they may not find misfortune,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not wander to destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the marshes sink and perish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though against God’s best intentions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though against the will of Ukko.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“From a distance bring a bugle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring a shepherd’s horn from heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring the honey-flute of Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Play the music of creation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blow the pipes of the magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Play the flowers on the highlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charm the hills, and dales, and mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charm the borders of the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill the forest-trees with honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill with spice the fountain-borders.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For my herds give food and shelter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed them all on honeyed pastures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give them drink at honeyed fountains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed them on thy golden grasses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the leaves of silver saplings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the springs of life and beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the crystal-waters flowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the waterfalls of Rutya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the uplands green and golden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the glens enriched in silver.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dig thou also golden fountains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the four sides of the willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the cows may drink in sweetness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And their udders swell with honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That their milk may flow in streamlets;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the milk be caught in vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the cow’s gift be not wasted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be not given to Manala.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Many are the sons of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That to Mana take their milkings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give their milk to evil-doers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waste it in Tuoni’s empire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Few there are, and they the worthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can get the milk from Mana;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never did my ancient mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ask for counsel in the village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never in the courts for wisdom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She obtained her milk from Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took the sour-milk from the dealers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet-milk from the greater distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the kingdom of Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Tuoni’s fields and pastures;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought it in the dusk of evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the by-ways in the darkness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the wicked should not know it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That it should not find destruction.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This the language of my mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these words I also echo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Whither does the cow’s gift wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither has the milk departed?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has it gone to feed the strangers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Banished to the distant village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gone to feed the hamlet-lover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or perchance to feed the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disappeared within the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scattered o’er the hills and mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mingled with the lakes and rivers?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It shall never go to Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never go to feed the stranger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never to the village-lover;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither shall it feed the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor be lost upon the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither sprinkled in the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor be mingled with the waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is needed for our tables,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worthy food for all our children.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Summer-daughter, maid of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Southern daughter of Creation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give Suotikki tender fodder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Watikki, give pure water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Hermikki milk abundant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fresh provisions to Tuorikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Mairikki let the milk flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fresh milk from my cows in plenty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coming from the tips of grasses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the tender herbs and leaflets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the meadows rich in honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the mother of the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the meadows sweetly dripping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the berry-laden branches,</span>

				<span>From the verdure-maiden bowers,</span>

				<span>From the clouds of milk-providers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the virgin of the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the milk may flow abundant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the cows that I have given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the keeping of Kullervo.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Rise thou virgin of the valley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the springs arise in beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise thou maiden of the fountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful, arise in ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take the waters from the cloudlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my roaming herds besprinkle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That my cows may drink and flourish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May be ready for the coming</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the shepherdess of evening.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O Millikki, forest-hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mother of the herds at pasture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send the tallest of thy servants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send the best of thine assistants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That my herds may well be guarded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the pleasant days of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Given us by our Creator.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Beauteous virgin of the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tapio’s most charming daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair Tellervo, forest-maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Softly clad in silken raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful in golden ringlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do thou give my herds protection,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Metsola dominions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the hills of Tapiola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shield them with thy hands of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stroke them gently with thy fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give to them a golden lustre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make them shine like fins of salmon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grow them robes as soft as ermine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When the evening star brings darkness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When appears the hour of twilight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send my lowing cattle homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Milk within their vessels coursing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Water on their backs in lakelets.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the Sun has set in ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the evening-bird is singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus address my herds of cattle:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye that carry horns, now hasten</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the sheds of Ilmarinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye enriched in milk go homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hostess now in waiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Home, the better place for sleeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forest-beds are full of danger;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the evening comes in darkness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway journey to the milkmaids</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Building fires to light the pathway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the turf enriched in honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the pastures berry-laden!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou, O Tapio’s son, Nyrikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forest-son, enrobed in purple,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut the fir-trees on the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut the pines with cones of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay them o’er the streams for bridges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cover well the sloughs of quicksand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the swamps and in the lowlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That my herd may pass in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On their long and dismal journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the clouds of smoke may hasten,</span>

				<span>If the cows heed not this order,</span>

				<span>Do not hasten home at evening,</span>

				<span>Then, O service-berry maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut a birch-rod from the glen-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the juniper, a whip-stick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near to Tapio’s spacious mansion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Standing on the ash-tree mountain,</span>

				<span>Woodland bear, with honeyed fingers,</span>

				<span>That thou wilt not kill my cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt not eat my milk-providers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I will not send my hunters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To destroy thee and thy kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never in the days of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Creator’s warmest season.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dost thou hear the tones of cow-bells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear the calling of the bugles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hide thyself within the meadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sink upon the turf in slumber,</span>

				<span>Bury both thine ears in clover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crouch within some alder-thicket</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Climb between the mossy ledges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Visit thou some rocky cavern,</span>

				<span>Flee away to other mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till thou canst not hear the cow-bells,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Sacred bear with honeyed fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To approach the herd of cattle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou thyself art not forbidden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thy tongue, and teeth, and fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must not touch my herd in summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must not harm my harmless creatures.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go around the scented meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amble through the milky pastures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the tones of bells and shepherds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should the herd be on the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go thou quickly to the marshes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should my cattle browse the lowlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleep thou then within the thicket;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should they feed upon the uplands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou must hasten to the valley;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should the herd graze at the bottom,</span>

				<span>Through the vales and mountain by-ways,</span>

			<p>
				<span>“Call to mind our former pledges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the river of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the waterfall and whirlpool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the ears of our Creator.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrice to Otso was it granted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the circuit of the summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To approach the land of cow-bells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the herdsmen’s voices echo;</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Come upon thee in thy roamings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should thy bloody teeth feel hunger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throw thy malice to the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thy hunger to the pine-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sink thy teeth within the aspens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dead limbs of the birches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prune the dry stalks from the willows.</span>

				<span>Feed thy hunger on the ant-hills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eat the red roots of the bear-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Metsola’s rich cakes of honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the grass my herd would feed on.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or if Metsola’s rich honey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should ferment before the eating,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the hills of golden color,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the mountains filled with silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is other food for hunger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Other drink for thirsting Otso,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everlasting will the food be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the drink be never wanting.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Let us now agree in honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And conclude a lasting treaty</span>

				<span>That our lives may end in pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May be merry in the summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both enjoy the woods in common,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though our food must be distinctive.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou still desire to fight me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let our contests be in winter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let our wars be on the snow-fields.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swamps will thaw in days of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Warm, the water in the rivers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore shouldst thou break this treaty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou come where golden cattle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roam these woodland hills and valleys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We will slay thee with our crossbows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should our arrow-men be absent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have here some archer-women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And among them is the hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can use the fatal weapon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can bring thee to destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus will end the days of trouble</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou bringest to our people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And against the will of Ukko.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ukko, ruler in the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lend an ear to my entreaty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Metamorphose all my cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the mighty force of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into stumps and stones convert them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the enemy should wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near my herd in days of summer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If I had been born an Otso,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would never stride and amble</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the feet of aged women;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elsewhere there are hills and valleys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farther on are honey-pastures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the lazy bear may wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the indolent may linger;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sneak away to yonder mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy tender flesh may lessen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the blue-glen’s deep recesses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the bear-dens of the forest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst move through fields of acorns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the sand and ocean-pebbles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There for thee is tracked a pathway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the woodlands on the sea-coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Northland’s farthest limits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dismal plains of Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There ’tis well for thee to lumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to live will be a pleasure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shoeless there to walk in summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stockingless in days of autumn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue-back of the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the swamps and fertile lowlands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If thou canst not journey thither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Canst not find the Lapland-highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hasten on a little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the bear-path leading northward.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the grove of Tuonela,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the honey-plains of Kalma,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swamps there are in which to wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heaths in which to roam at pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There are Kiryos, there are Karyos,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of beasts a countless number,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their fetters strong as iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fattening within the forest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be ye gracious, groves and mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of grace, ye darksome thickets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peace and plenty to my cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the pleasant days of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Creator’s warmest season.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Knippana, O King of forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou the gray-beard of the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Watch thy dogs in fen and fallow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay a sponge within one nostril,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And an acorn in the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they may not scent my cattle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tie their eyes with silken fillets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they may not see my herdlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not see my cattle grazing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Should all this seem inefficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive away thy barking children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let them run to other forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let them hunt in other marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From these verdant strips of meadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From these far outstretching borders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hide thy dogs within thy caverns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Firmly tie thy yelping children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tie them with thy golden fetters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thy chains adorned with silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they may not do me damage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not do a deed of mischief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Should all this prove inefficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou, O Ukko, King of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wise director, full of mercy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear the golden words I utter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear a voice that breathes affection,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the alder make a muzzle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For each dog within the kennel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should the alder prove too feeble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast a band of purest copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should the copper prove a failure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge a band of ductile iron;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should the iron snap asunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In each nose a small-ring fasten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made of molten gold and silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chain thy dogs in forest-caverns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That my herd may not be injured.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the wife of Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Life-companion of the blacksmith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Opened all her yards and stables,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led her herd across the meadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Placed them in the herdman’s keeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the care of Kullerwoinen.</span>
