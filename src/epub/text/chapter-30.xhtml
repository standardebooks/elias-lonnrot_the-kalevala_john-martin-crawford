				<span>Lemminkainen, reckless minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens as the dawn is breaking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the dawning of the morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the resting-place of vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the harbor of the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds the vessels sorely weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hears the wailing of the rigging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the ships intone this chorus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Must we wretched lie forever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the harbor of this island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here to dry and fall in pieces?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ahti wars no more in Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wars no more for sixty summers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even should he thirst for silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should he wish the gold of battle.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen struck his vessels</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his gloves adorned with copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And addressed the ships as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mourn no more, my ships of fir-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strong and hardy is your rigging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the wars ye soon may hasten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hasten to the seas of battle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Warriors may swarm your cabins</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere to-morrow’s morn has risen.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the reckless Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to his aged mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake to her the words that follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Weep no longer, faithful mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not sorrow for thy hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should he leave for scenes of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the hostile fields of Pohya;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet revenge has fired my spirit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my soul is well determined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To avenge the shameful insult</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the warriors of Northland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave to thee, defenseless woman.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To restrain him seeks his mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Warns her son again of danger:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do not go, my son beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the wars in Sariola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the jaws of Death await thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell destruction lies before thee!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen, little heeding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still determined, speaks as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Where may I secure a swordsman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worthy of my race of heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To assist me in the combat?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often I have heard of Tiera,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard of Kura of the islands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This one I will take to help me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Magic hero of the broadsword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will aid me in the combat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will protect me from destruction.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he wandered to the islands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the way to Tiera’s hamlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words that Ahti utters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he nears the ancient dwellings:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Dearest friend, my noble Tiera,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My beloved hero-brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou other times remember,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When we fought and bled together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the battle-fields of Northland?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was not an island-village</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where there were not seven mansions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In each mansion seven heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not one of all these foemen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom we did not slay with broadswords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Victims of our skill and valor.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the window sat the father</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whittling out a javelin-handle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the threshold sat the mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skimming cream and making butter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the portal stood the brother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Working on a sledge of birch-wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the bridge-pass were the sisters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Washing out their varied garments.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the father from the window,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the threshold spake the mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the portals spake the brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sisters from the bridge-pass:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tiera has no time for combat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his broadsword cannot battle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tiera is but late a bridegroom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still unveiled his bride awaits him.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the hearth was Tiera lying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lying by the fire was Kura,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastily one foot was shoeing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the other lay in waiting.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the hook he takes his girdle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Buckles it around his body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes a javelin from its resting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the largest, nor the smallest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Buckles on his mighty scabbard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dons his heavy mail of copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On each javelin pranced a charger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wolves were howling from his helmet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the rings the bears were growling.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tiera poised his mighty javelin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Launched the spear upon its errand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurled the shaft across the pasture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the border of the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the clay-fields of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the green and fragrant meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the distant bills of Northland.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then great Tiera touched his javelin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the mighty spear of Ahti,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pledged his aid to Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As his combatant and comrade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon wild Kaukomieli</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pushed his boat upon the waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the serpent through the heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the creeping of the adder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sails the boat away to Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the seas of Sariola.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the wicked hostess, Louhi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sends the black-frost of the heavens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the waters of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the far-extending sea-plains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave the black-frost these directions:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Much-loved Frost, my son and hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom thy mother has instructed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hasten whither I may send thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go wherever I command thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze the vessel of this hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s bark of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the broad back of the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the far-extending waters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze the wizard in his vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze to ice the wicked Ahti,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he never more may wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never waken while thou livest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or at least till I shall free him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wake him from his icy slumber!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frost, the son of wicked parents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hero-son of evil manners,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens off to freeze the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goes to fasten down the flood-gates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goes to still the ocean-currents.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he hastens on his journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the leaves from all the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strips the meadows of their verdure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Robs the flowers of their colors.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When his journey he had ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gained the border of the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gained the sea-shore curved and endless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the first night of his visit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freezes he the lakes and rivers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freezes too the shore of ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freezes not the ocean-billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not check the ocean-currents.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the sea a finch is resting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bird of song upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But his feet are not yet frozen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither is his head endangered.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the second night Frost lingered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He began to grow important,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He became a fierce intruder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fearless grew in his invasions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freezes everything before him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sends the fiercest cold of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turns to ice the boundless waters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever thicker, thicker, thicker,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grew the ice on sea and ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever deeper, deeper, deeper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell the snow on field and forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Froze the hero’s ship of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cold and lifeless bark of Ahti;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought to freeze wild Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze him lifeless as his vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked the minstrel for his life-blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his ears, and feet, and fingers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Angry grew and filled with magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurled the black-frost to the fire-god,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threw him to the fiery furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held him in his forge of iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then addressed the frost as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Frost, thou evil son of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dire and only son of Winter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let my members not be stiffened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither ears, nor feet, nor fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither let my head be frozen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast other things to feed on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many other beads to stiffen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave in peace the flesh of heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let this minstrel pass in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze the swamps, and lakes, and rivers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fens and forests, bills and valleys;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the cold stones grow still colder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze the willows in the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the aspens freeze and suffer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the bark peel from the birch-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the Pines burst on the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let this hero pass in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not let his locks be stiffened.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If all these prove insufficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed on other worthy matters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the hot stones freeze asunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the flaming rocks be frozen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze the fiery blocks of iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze to ice the iron mountains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stiffen well the mighty Wuoksi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let Imatra freeze to silence;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze the sacred stream and whirlpool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let their boiling billows stiffen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or thine origin I’ll sing thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell thy lineage of evil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well I know thine evil nature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know thine origin and power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence thou camest, where thou goest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know thine ancestry of evil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wert born upon the aspen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wert conceived upon the willows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the borders of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the courts of dismal Northland;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sin-begotten was thy father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thy mother was Dishonor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“While in infancy who fed thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While thy mother could not nurse thee?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely thou wert fed by adders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nursed by foul and slimy serpents;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>North-winds rocked thee into slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cradled thee in roughest weather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the worst of willow-marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the springs forever flowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evil-born and evil-nurtured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grew to be an evil genius,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evil was thy mind and spirit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the infant still was nameless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the name of Frost was given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the progeny of evil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then the young lad lived in hedges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dwelt among the weeds and willows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lived in springs in days of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the borders of the marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tore the lindens in the winter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stormed among the glens and forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raged among the sacred birch-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rattled in the alder-branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Froze the trees, the shoots, the grasses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evened all the plains and prairies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ate the leaves within the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the stalks drop down their blossoms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peeled the bark on weeds and willows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou hast grown to large proportions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast become too tall and mighty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou labor to benumb me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou wish mine ears and fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my feet wouldst thou deprive me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not strive to freeze this hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his anguish and misfortune;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my stockings I shall kindle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire to drive thee from my presence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my shoes lay flaming faggots,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coals of fire in every garment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heated sandstones in my rigging;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus will hold thee at a distance.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then thine evil form I’ll banish</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the farthest Northland borders;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thy journey is completed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thy home is reached in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze the caldrons in the castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze the coal upon the hearthstone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dough, the hands of women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On its mother’s lap, the infant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freeze the colt beside its mother.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If thou shouldst not heed this order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall banish thee still farther,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the carbon-piles of Hisi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the chimney-hearth of Lempo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurl thee to his fiery furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay thee on the iron anvil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy body may be hammered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the sledges of the blacksmith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May be pounded into atoms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Twixt the anvil and the hammer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If thou shouldst not heed this order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst not leave me to my freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know I still another kingdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know another spot of resting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall drive thee to the summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead thy tongue to warmer climates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There a prisoner to suffer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never to obtain thy freedom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till thy spirit I deliver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till I go myself and free thee.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wicked Frost, the son of Winter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the magic bird of evil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hovering above his spirit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway prayed for Ahti’s mercy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words the Frost-fiend uttered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let us now agree together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither one to harm the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never in the course of ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never while the moonlight glimmers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the snow-capped hills of Northland.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou hearest that I bring thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cold to freeze thy feet and fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurl me to the fiery furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hammer me upon the anvil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the blacksmith, Ilmarinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead my tongue to warmer climates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Banish me to lands of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There a prisoner to suffer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nevermore to gain my freedom.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left his vessel in the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frozen in the ice of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left his warlike boat forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Started on his cheerless journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the borders of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the mighty Tiera followed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the tracks of his companion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the ice they journeyed northward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Briskly walked upon the ice-plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walked one day, and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the closing of the third day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the Hunger-land approached them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When appeared Starvation-island.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here the hardy Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened forward to the castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the hero’s prayer and question:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is there food within this castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fish or fowl within its larders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To refresh us on our journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mighty heroes, cold and weary?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the hero, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found no food within the castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither fish, nor fowl, nor bacon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus he cursed it and departed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“May the fire destroy these chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May the waters flood this dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wash it to the seas of Mana!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then they hastened onward, onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened on through field and forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over by-ways long untrodden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over unknown paths and snow-fields;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here the hardy Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reckless hero, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pulled the soft wool from the ledges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathered lichens from the tree-trunks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wove them into magic stockings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wove them into shoes and mittens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the settles of the hoar-frost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the stinging cold of Northland.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he sought to find some pathway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That would guide their wayward footsteps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the hero spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou Tiera, friend beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall we reach our destination,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandering for days together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through these Northland fields and forests?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kura thus replies to Ahti:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“We, alas! have come for vengeance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come for blood and retribution,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the battle-fields of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dismal Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here to leave our souls and bodies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here to starve, and freeze, and perish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dreariest of places,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this sun-forsaken country!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never shall we gain the knowledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never learn it, never tell it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which the pathway that can guide us</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the forest-beds to suffer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Pohya-plains to perish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the home-land of the ravens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fitting food for crows and eagles.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often do the Northland vultures</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither come to feed their fledgelings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither bring the birds of heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bits of flesh and blood of heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often do the beaks of ravens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tear the flesh of kindred corpses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often do the eagle’s talons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carry bones and trembling vitals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as ours, to feed their nestlings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In their rocky homes and ledges.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Oh! my mother can but wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never can divine the answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where her reckless son is roaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where her hero’s blood is flowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether in the swamps and lowlands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether in the heat of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or upon the waves of the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or upon the hop-field mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or along some forest by-way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing can her mind discover</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the frailest of her heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only think that he has perished.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the hoary-headed mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeps and murmurs in her chambers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Where is now my son beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the kingdom of Manala?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sow thy crops, thou dread Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harrow well the fields of Kalma!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the bow receives its respite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fingers of my Tiera;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bow and arrow now are useless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the merry birds can fatten</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the fields, and fens, and forests;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bears may live in dens of freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the fields may sport the elk-herds.’ ”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thus it is, mine aged mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou that gavest me existence!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast reared thy broods of chickens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hatched and reared thy flights of white-swans</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All of them the winds have scattered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the evil Lempo frightened;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One flew hither, and one thither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a third one, lost forever!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Think thou of our former pleasures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of our better days together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I wandered like the flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the berry in the meadows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many saw my form majestic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many thought me well-proportioned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now is not as then with Ahti,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into evil days have fallen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since I see but storms and darkness!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then my eyes beheld but sunshine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then we did not weep and murmur,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not fill our hearts with sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the maids in joy were singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the virgins twined their tresses;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the women joined in joyance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether brides were happy-wedded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether bridegrooms choose discreetly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether they were wise or unwise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“But we must not grow disheartened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the Island-maidens cheer us;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here we are not yet enchanted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not bewitched by magic singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the paths not left to perish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sink and perish on our journey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of youth we should not suffer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strong, we should not die unworthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom the wizards have enchanted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have bewitched with songs of magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sorcerers may charm and conquer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bury them within their dungeons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hide them spell-bound in their cabins.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the wizards charm each other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bewitch their magic offspring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring their tribes to fell destruction.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never did my gray-haired father</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bow submission to a wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Offer worship to magicians.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words my father uttered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the thoughts his son advances:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Guard us, thou O great Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shield us, thou O God of mercy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thine arms of grace protect us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Help us with thy strength and wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guide the minds of all thy heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep aright the thoughts of women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep the old from speaking evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep the young from sin and folly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be to us a help forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be our Guardian and our Father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That our children may not wander</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the ways of their Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the path that God has given!’ ”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the hero Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made from cares the fleetest racers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sable racers from his sorrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reins he made from days of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his sacred pains made saddles.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the saddle, quickly springing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Galloped he away from trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his dear and aged mother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his comrade, faithful Tiera,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Galloped to his Island-dwelling.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now departs wild Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brave and reckless Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From these ancient songs and legends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only guides his faithful Kura</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his waiting bride and kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While these lays and incantations</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall be turned to other heroes.</span>
