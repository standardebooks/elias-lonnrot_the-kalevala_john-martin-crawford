<p>Ilmarinen, the magician,<br/>
The eternal metal-artist,<br/>
Lays aside the golden image,<br/>
Beauteous maid of magic metals;<br/>
Throws the harness on his courser,<br/>
Binds him to his sledge of birch-wood,<br/>
Seats himself upon the cross-bench,<br/>
Snaps the whip above the racer,<br/>
Thinking once again to journey<br/>
To the mansions of Pohyola,<br/>
There to woo a bride in honor,<br/>
Second daughter of the Northland.<br/>
On he journeyed, restless, northward,<br/>
Journeyed one day, then a second,<br/>
So the third from morn till evening,<br/>
When he reached a Northland-village<br/>
On the plains of Sariola.<br/>
Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br/>
Standing in the open court-yard,<br/>
Spied the hero, Ilmarinen,<br/>
Thus addressed the metal-worker:<br/>
“Tell me how my child is living,<br/>
How the Bride of Beauty prospers,<br/>
As a daughter to thy mother.”<br/>
Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br/>
Head bent down and brow dejected,<br/>
Thus addressed the Northland hostess:<br/>
“O, thou dame of Sariola,<br/>
Do not ask me of thy daughter,<br/>
Since, alas I in Tuonela<br/>
Sleeps the Maiden of the Rainbow,<br/>
Sleeps in death the Bride, of Beauty,<br/>
Underneath the fragrant heather,<br/>
In the kingdom of Manala.<br/>
Come I for a second daughter,<br/>
For the fairest of thy virgins.<br/>
Beauteous hostess of Pohyola,<br/>
Give to me thy youngest maiden,<br/>
For my former wife’s compartments,<br/>
For the chambers of her sister.”<br/>
Louhi, hostess of the Northland,<br/>
Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<br/>
“Foolish was the Northland-hostess,<br/>
When she gave her fairest virgin,<br/>
In the bloom of youth and beauty<br/>
To the blacksmith of Wainola,<br/>
Only to be led to Mana,<br/>
Like a lambkin to the slaughter!<br/>
I shall never give my daughter,<br/>
Shall not give my youngest maiden<br/>
Bride of thine to be hereafter,<br/>
Life-companion at thy fireside.<br/>
Sooner would I give the fair one<br/>
To the cataract and whirlpool,<br/>
To the river of Manala,<br/>
To the waters of Tuoni!”<br/>
Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,<br/>
Drew away his head, disdainful,<br/>
Shook his sable locks in anger,<br/>
Entered to the inner court-room,<br/>
Where the maiden sat in waiting,<br/>
Spake these measures to the daughter:<br/>
“Come with me, thou bright-eyed maiden,<br/>
To the cottage where thy sister<br/>
Lived and lingered in contentment,<br/>
Baked for me the toothsome biscuit,<br/>
Brewed for me the beer of barley,<br/>
Kept my dwelling-place in order.”<br/>
On the floor a babe was lying,<br/>
Thus he sang to Ilmarinen:<br/>
“Uninvited, leave this mansion,<br/>
Go, thou stranger, from this dwelling;<br/>
Once before thou camest hither,<br/>
Only bringing pain and trouble,<br/>
Filling all our hearts with sorrow.<br/>
Fairest daughter of my mother,<br/>
Do not give this suitor welcome,<br/>
Look not on his eyes with pleasure,<br/>
Nor admire his form and features.<br/>
In his mouth are only wolf-teeth,<br/>
Cunning fox-claws in his mittens,<br/>
In his shoes art only bear-claws,<br/>
In his belt a hungry dagger;<br/>
Weapons these of blood and murder,<br/>
Only worn by the unworthy.”<br/>
Then the daughter spake as follows<br/>
To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:<br/>
“Follow thee this maid will never,<br/>
Never heed unworthy suitors;<br/>
Thou hast slain the Bride of Beauty,<br/>
Once the Maiden of the Rainbow,<br/>
Thou wouldst also slay her sister.<br/>
I deserve a better suitor,<br/>
Wish a truer, nobler husband,<br/>
Wish to ride in richer sledges,<br/>
Have a better home-protection;<br/>
Never will I sweep the cottage<br/>
And the coal-place of a blacksmith.”<br/>
Then the hero, Ilmarinen,<br/>
The eternal metal-artist,<br/>
Turned his head away, disdainful,<br/>
Shook his sable locks in anger,<br/>
Quickly seized the trembling maiden,<br/>
Held her in his grasp of iron,<br/>
Hastened from the court of Louhi<br/>
To his sledge upon the highway.<br/>
In his sleigh he seats the virgin,<br/>
Snugly wraps her in his far-robes,<br/>
Snaps his whip above the racer,<br/>
Gallops on the high-road homeward;<br/>
With one hand the reins be tightens,<br/>
With the other holds the maiden.<br/>
Speaks the virgin-daughter, weeping:<br/>
We have reached the lowland-berries,<br/>
Here the herbs of water-borders;<br/>
Leave me here to sink and perish<br/>
As a child of cold misfortune.<br/>
Wicked Ilmarinen, listen!<br/>
If thou dost not quickly free me,<br/>
I will break thy sledge to pieces,<br/>
Throw thy fur-robes to the north-winds.”<br/>
Ilmarinen makes this answer:<br/>
“When the blacksmith builds his snow-sledge,<br/>
All the parts are hooped with iron;<br/>
Therefore will the beauteous maiden<br/>
Never beat my sledge to fragments.”<br/>
Then the silver-tinselled daughter<br/>
Wept and wailed in bitter accents,<br/>
Wrung her hands in desperation,<br/>
Spake again to Ilmarinen:<br/>
“If thou dost not quickly free me,<br/>
I shall change to ocean-salmon,<br/>
Be a whiting of the waters.”<br/>
“Thou wilt never thus escape me,<br/>
As a pike I’ll fleetly follow.”<br/>
Then the maiden of Pohyola<br/>
Wept and wailed in bitter accents,<br/>
Wrung her hands in desperation,<br/>
Spake again to Ilmarinen;<br/>
“If thou dost not quickly free me,<br/>
I shall hasten to the forest,<br/>
Mid the rocks become an ermine!”<br/>
“Thou wilt never thus escape me,<br/>
As a serpent I will follow.”<br/>
Then the beauty of the Northland,<br/>
Wailed and wept in bitter accents,<br/>
Wrung her hands in desperation,<br/>
Spake once more to Ilmarinen:<br/>
“Surely, if thou dost not free me,<br/>
As a lark I’ll fly the ether,<br/>
Hide myself within the storm-clouds.”<br/>
“Neither wilt thou thus escape me,<br/>
As an eagle I will follow.”<br/>
They had gone but little distance,<br/>
When the courser shied and halted,<br/>
Frighted at some passing object;<br/>
And the maiden looked in wonder,<br/>
In the snow beheld some foot-prints,<br/>
Spake these words to Ilmarinen:<br/>
Who has run across our highway?”<br/>
“’Tis the timid hare”, he answered.<br/>
Thereupon the stolen maiden<br/>
Sobbed, and moaned, in deeps of sorrow,<br/>
Heavy-hearted, spake these measures:<br/>
“Woe is me, ill-fated virgin!<br/>
Happier far my life hereafter,<br/>
If the hare I could but follow<br/>
To his burrow in the woodlands!<br/>
Crook-leg’s fur to me is finer<br/>
Than the robes of Ilmarinen.”<br/>
Ilmarinen, the magician,<br/>
Tossed his head in full resentment,<br/>
Galloped on the highway homeward,<br/>
Travelled but a little distance,<br/>
When again his courser halted,<br/>
Frighted at some passing stranger.<br/>
Quick the maiden looked and wondered,<br/>
In the snow beheld some foot-prints,<br/>
Spake these measures to the blacksmith:<br/>
Who has crossed our snowy pathway?”<br/>
“’Tis a fox”, replied the minstrel.<br/>
Thereupon the beauteous virgin<br/>
Moaned again in depths of anguish,<br/>
Sang these accents, heavy-hearted:<br/>
“Woe is me, ill-fated maiden!<br/>
Happier far my life hereafter,<br/>
With the cunning fox to wander,<br/>
Than with this ill-mannered suitor;<br/>
Reynard’s fur to me is finer<br/>
Than the robes of Ilmarinen.”<br/>
Thereupon the metal-worker<br/>
Shut his lips in sore displeasure,<br/>
Hastened on the highway homeward;<br/>
Travelled but a little distance,<br/>
When again his courser halted.<br/>
Quick the maiden looked in wonder,<br/>
in the snow beheld some foot-prints,<br/>
Spake these words to the magician:<br/>
Who again has crossed our pathway?”<br/>
“’Tis the wolf”, said Ilmarinen.<br/>
Thereupon the fated daughter<br/>
Fell again to bitter weeping,<br/>
And Intoned these words of sorrow:<br/>
“Woe is me, a hapless maiden!<br/>
Happier far my life hereafter,<br/>
Brighter far would be my future,<br/>
If these tracks I could but follow;<br/>
On the wolf the hair is finer<br/>
Than the furs of Ilmarinen,<br/>
Faithless suitor of the Northland.”<br/>
Then the minstrel of Wainola<br/>
Closed his lips again in anger,<br/>
Shook his sable locks, resentful,<br/>
Snapped the whip above the racer,<br/>
And the steed flew onward swiftly,<br/>
O’er the way to Kalevala,<br/>
To the village of the blacksmith.<br/>
Sad and weary from his journey,<br/>
Ilmarinen, home-returning,<br/>
Fell upon his couch in slumber,<br/>
And the maiden laughed derision.<br/>
In the morning, slowly waking,<br/>
Head confused, and locks dishevelled,<br/>
Spake the wizard, words as follow:<br/>
“Shall I set myself to singing<br/>
Magic songs and incantations?<br/>
Shall I now enchant this maiden<br/>
To a black-wolf on the mountains,<br/>
To a salmon of the ocean?<br/>
Shall not send her to the woodlands,<br/>
All the forest would be frighted;<br/>
Shall not send her to the waters,<br/>
All the fish would flee in terror;<br/>
This my sword shall drink her life-blood,<br/>
End her reign of scorn and hatred.”<br/>
Quick the sword feels his intention,<br/>
Quick divines his evil purpose,<br/>
Speaks these words to Ilmarinen:<br/>
“Was not born to drink the life-blood<br/>
Of a maiden pure and lovely,<br/>
Of a fair but helpless virgin.”<br/>
Thereupon the magic minstrel,<br/>
Filled with rage, began his singing;<br/>
Sang the very rocks asunder,<br/>
Till the distant hills re-echoed;<br/>
Sang the maiden to a sea-gull,<br/>
Croaking from the ocean-ledges,<br/>
Calling from the ocean-islands,<br/>
Screeching on the sandy sea-coast,<br/>
Flying to the winds opposing.<br/>
When his conjuring had ended,<br/>
Ilmarinen joined his snow-sledge,<br/>
Whipped his steed upon a gallop,<br/>
Hastened to his ancient smithy,<br/>
To his home in Kalevala.<br/>
Wainamoinen, old and truthful,<br/>
Comes to meet him on the highway,<br/>
Speaks these words to the magician:<br/>
“Ilmarinen, worthy brother,<br/>
Wherefore comest heavy-hearted<br/>
From the dismal Sariola?<br/>
Does Pohyola live and prosper?<br/>
Spake the minstrel, Ilmarinen:<br/>
“Why should not Pohyola prosper?<br/>
There the Sampo grinds unceasing,<br/>
Noisy rocks the lid in colors;<br/>
Grinds one day the flour for eating,<br/>
Grinds the second flour for selling,<br/>
Grinds the third day flour for keeping;<br/>
Thus it is Pohyola prospers.<br/>
While the Sampo is in Northland,<br/>
There is plowing, there is sowing,<br/>
There is growth of every virtue,<br/>
There is welfare never-ending.”<br/>
Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:<br/>
“Ilmarinen, artist-brother,<br/>
Where then is the Northland-daughter,<br/>
Far renowned and beauteous maiden,<br/>
For whose hand thou hast been absent?<br/>
These the words of Ilmarinen:<br/>
“I have changed the hateful virgin<br/>
To a sea-gull on the ocean;<br/>
Now she calls above the waters,<br/>
Screeches from the ocean-islands;<br/>
On the rocks she calls and murmurs<br/>
Vainly calling for a suitor.”</p>
