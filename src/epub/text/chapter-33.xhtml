			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the lad, Kullervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid his luncheon in his basket,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drove the herd to mountain-pastures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the hills and through the marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To their grazings in the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaking as he careless wandered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Of the youth am I the poorest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hapless lad and full of trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evil luck to me befallen!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I alas! must idly wander</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the hills and through the valleys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a watch-dog for the cattle!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then she sat upon the greensward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a sunny spot selected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing, chanting words as follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Shine, O shine, thou Sun of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast thy rays, thou fire of Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the herdsman of the blacksmith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the head of Kullerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this poor and luckless shepherd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not in Ilmarinen’s smithy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the dwellings of his people;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good the table of the hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cuts the best of wheaten biscuit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Honey-cakes she cuts in slices,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spreading each with golden butter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only dry bread has the herdsman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eats with pain the oaten bread-crusts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled with chaff his and biscuit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feeds upon the worst of straw-bread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pine-tree bark, the broad he feeds on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sipping water from the birch-bark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drinking from the tips of grasses!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go, O Sun, and go, O barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haste away, thou light of Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hide within the mountain pine-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go, O wheat, to yonder thickets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the trees of purple berries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the junipers and alders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Safely lead the herdsman homeward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the biscuit golden-buttered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the honeyed cakes and viands!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While the shepherd lad was singing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen’s song and echo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen’s wife was feasting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the sweetest bread of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the toothsome cakes of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the richest of provisions;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only laid aside some cabbage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the herdsman, Kullerwoinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set apart some wasted fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leavings of the dogs at dinner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the shepherd, home returning.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the woods a bird came flying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang this song to Kullerwoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“ ’Tis the time for forest-dinners,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the fatherless companion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the herds to eat his viands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eat the good things from his basket!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kullerwoinen heard the songster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked upon the Sun’s long shadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway spake the words that follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“True, the singing of the song-bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is time indeed for feasting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Time to eat my basket-dinner.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon young Kullerwoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called his herd to rest in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat upon a grassy hillock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took his basket from his shoulders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took therefrom the arid oat-loaf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned it over in his fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carefully the loaf inspected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words of ancient wisdom:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Many loaves are fine to look on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the outside seem delicious,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the inside, chaff and tan-bark!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the shepherd, Kullerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew his knife to cut his oat-loaf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut the hard and arid biscuit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cuts against a stone imprisoned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well imbedded in the centre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks his ancient knife in pieces;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the shepherd youth, Kullervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw his magic knife had broken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeping sore, he spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This, the blade that I bold sacred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the one thing that I honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Relic of my mother’s people!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the stone within this oat-loaf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this cheat-cake of the hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I my precious knife have broken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How shall I repay this insult,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How avenge this woman’s malice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the wages for deception?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From a tree the raven answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou little silver buckle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only son of old Kalervo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why art thou in evil humor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherefore sad in thy demeanor?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take a young shoot from the thicket,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take a birch-rod from the valley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive thy herd across the lowlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the quicksands of the marshes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the wolves let one half wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bear-dens, lead the other;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the forest wolves together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the bears down from the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call the wolves thy little children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the bears thy standard-bearers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive them like a cow-herd homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive them home like spotted cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive them to thy master’s milk-yards;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus thou wilt repay the hostess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her malice and derision.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the wizard answered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Kullerwoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wait, yea wait, thou bride of Hisi!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do I mourn my mother’s relic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mourn the keep-sake thou hast broken?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou thyself shalt mourn as sorely</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thy, cows come home at evening!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the tree he cuts a birch-wand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the juniper a whip-stick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drives the herd across the lowlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the quicksands of the marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the wolves lets one half wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bear-dens leads the other;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calls the wolves his little children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calls the bears his standard-bearers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Changes all his herd of cattle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into wolves and bears by magic.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the west the Sun is shining,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Telling that the night is coming.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the wizard, Kullerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanders o’er the pine-tree mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens through the forest homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drives the wolves and bears before him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the milk-yards of the hostess;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the herd he speaks as follows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As they journey on together:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tear and kill the wicked hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tear her guilty flesh in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she comes to view her cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When she stoops to do her milking!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the wizard, Kullerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From an ox-bone makes a bugle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes it from Tuonikki’s cow-horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes a flute from Kiryo’s shin-bone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plays a song upon his bugle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plays upon his flute of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrice upon the home-land hill-tops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Six times near the coming gate-ways.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen’s wife and hostess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long had waited for the coming</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her herd with Kullerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waited for the milk at evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waited for the new-made butter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the footsteps in the cow-path,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the heath she beard the bustle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these joyous words of welcome:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Be thou praised, O gracious Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That my herd is home returning!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I hear a bugle sounding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis the playing of my herdsman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Playing on a magic cow-horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bursting all our ears with music!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kullerwoinen, drawing nearer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hostess spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Found the bugle in the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the flute among the rushes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All thy herd are in the passage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All thy cows within the hurdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the time to build the camp-fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the time to do the milking!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen’s wife, the hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed an aged servant:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Go, thou old one, to the milking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have the care of all my cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not ask for mine assistance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since I have to knead the biscuit.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Always does the worthy hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever does the wisdom-mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go herself and do the milking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tend the cows within the hurdles!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the wife of Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built a field-fire in the passage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went to milk her cows awaiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked upon her herd in wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these happy words of greeting:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Beautiful, my herd of cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glistening like the skins of lynxes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hair as soft as fur of ermine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peaceful waiting for the milk-pail!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the milk-stool sits the hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Milks one moment, then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then a third time milks and ceases;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the bloody wolves disguising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick attack the hostess milking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the bears lend their assistance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tear and mutilate her body</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their teeth and sharpened fingers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen, cruel wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus repaid the wicked hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus repaid her evil treatment.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick the wife of Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried aloud in bitter anguish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed the youth, Kullervo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Evil son, thou bloody herdsman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast brought me wolves in malice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Driven bears within my hurdles!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Kullerwoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have I evil done as shepherd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worse the conduct of the hostess;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Baked a stone inside my oat-cake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the inside, rock and tan-bark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the stone my knife, was broken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Treasure of my mother’s household,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broken virtue of my people!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen’s wife made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Noble herdsman, Kullerwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Change, I pray thee, thine opinion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take away thine incantations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the bears and wolves release me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save me from this spell of torture</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will give thee better raiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give the best of milk and butter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set for thee the sweetest table;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt live with me in welcome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Need not labor for thy keeping.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou dost not free me quickly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost not break this spell of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall sink into the Death-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall return to Tuonela.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is Kullerwoinen’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“It is best that thou shouldst perish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let destruction overtake thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is ample room in Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Room for all the dead in Kalma,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the worthiest must slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There must rest the good and evil.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen’s wife made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ukko, thou O God in heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Span the strongest of thy cross-bows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Test the weapon by thy wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay an arrow forged from copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the cross-bow of thy forging;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rightly aim thy flaming arrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thy magic hurl the missile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shoot this wizard through the vitals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pierce the heart of Kullerwoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the lightning of the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thine arrows tipped with copper.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kullerwoinen prays as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ukko, God of truth and justice.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not slay thy magic servant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slay the wife of Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kill in her the worst of women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these hurdles let her perish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest she wander hence in freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To perform some other mischief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do some greater deed of malice!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick as lightning fell the hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the wife of Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell and perished in the hurdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the ground before her cottage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the death of Northland’s hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cherished wife of Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once the Maiden of the Rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wooed and watched for many summers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pride and joy of Kalevala!</span>
