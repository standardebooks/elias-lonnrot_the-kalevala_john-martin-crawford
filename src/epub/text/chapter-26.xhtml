				<span>Ahti, living on the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the Kauko-point and harbor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plowed his fields for rye and barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Furrowed his extensive pastures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard with quickened ears an uproar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the village in commotion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard a noise along the sea-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the foot-steps on the ice-plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the rattle of the sledges;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick his mind divined the reason,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knew it was Pohyola’s wedding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wedding of the Rainbow-virgin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick he stopped in disappointment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shook his sable locks in envy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned his hero-head in anger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the scarlet blood ceased flowing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through his pallid face and temples;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ceased his plowing and his sowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the field he left the furrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his steed he lightly mounted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway galloped fleetly homeward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his well-beloved mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his mother old and golden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave his mother these directions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My beloved, faithful mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly bring me beer and viands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me food for I am hungry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Food and drink for me abundant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have my bath-room quickly heated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly set the room in order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I may refresh my body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dress myself in hero-raiment.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s aged mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brings her hero food in plenty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beer and viands for the hungry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her thirsting son and hero;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick she heats the ancient bath-room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly sets his bath in order.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the reckless Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ate his meat with beer inspiring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to his bath awaiting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only was the bullfinch bathing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the many-colored bunting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the hero laved his temples,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laved himself to flaxen whiteness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick returning to his mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake in haste the words that follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My beloved, helpful mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go at once to yonder mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the store-house on the hill-top,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring my vest of finest texture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring my hero-coat of purple,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring my suit of magic colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to make me look attractive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to robe myself in beauty.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>First the ancient mother asked him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked her son this simple question:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whither dost thou go, my hero?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou go to hunt the roebuck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chase the lynx upon the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shoot the squirrel in the woodlands?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Also known as Kaukomieli:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Worthy mother of my being,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go I not to hunt the roebuck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chase the lynx upon the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shoot the squirrel on the tree-tops;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am going to Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the feasting of her people.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring at once my purple vestments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway bring my nuptial outfit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me don it for the marriage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the maiden of the Northland.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the ancient dame dissented,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wife forebade the husband;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two of all the best of heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three of nature’s fairest daughters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strongly urged wild Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to go to Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Pohyola’s great carousal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the marriage-feast of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Since thou hast not been invited,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since they do not wish thy presence.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Kaukomieli:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Where the wicked are invited,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the good are always welcome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Herein lies my invitation;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am constantly reminded</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By this sword of sharpened edges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By this magic blade and scabbard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Pohyola needs my presence.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s aged mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sought again to stay her hero:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do not go, my son beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the feasting in Pohyola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of horrors are the highways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the road are many wonders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three times Death appears to frighten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrice destruction hovers over!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Kaukomieli:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Death is seen by aged people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Everywhere they see perdition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death can never frighten heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heroes do not fear the spectre;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be that as it may, dear mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell that I may understand thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Name the first of all destructions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Name the first and last destroyers!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will tell thee, son and hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not because I wish to speak it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But because the truth is worthy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will name the chief destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Name the first of the destroyers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thou hast a distance journeyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only one day hast thou travelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comes a stream along the highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stream of fire of wondrous beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the stream a mighty fire-spout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the spout a rock uprising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the rock a fiery hillock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the top a flaming eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his crooked beak he sharpens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sharpens too his bloody talons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the coming of the stranger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the people that approach him.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Women die beneath the eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such is not the death of heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know I well a magic lotion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will heal the wounds of eagles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make myself a steed of alders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will walk as my companion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will stride ahead majestic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a duck I’ll drive behind him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive him o’er the fatal waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Underneath the flaming eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his bloody beak and talons.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worthy mother of my being,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Name the second of destroyers.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This the second of destroyers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thou hast a distance wandered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only two clays hast thou travelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comes a pit of fire to meet thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the centre of the highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eastward far the pit extending,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stretches endless to the westward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled with burning coals and pebbles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glowing with the heat of ages;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hundreds has this monster swallowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his jaws have thousands perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hundreds with their trusty broadswords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thousands on their fiery chargers.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Never will the hero perish</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the jaws of such a monster;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know I well the means of safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know a remedy efficient:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will make of snow a master,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the snow-clad fields, a hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive the snow-man on before me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive him through the flaming vortex,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive him through the fiery furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my magic broom of copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will follow in his shadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Follow close the magic image,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus escape the frightful monster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my golden locks uninjured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my flowing beard untangled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient mother of my being,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Name the last of the destructions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Name the third of the destroyers.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This the third of fatal dangers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast thou gone a greater distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast thou travelled one day longer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the portals of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the narrowest of gate-ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There a wolf will rise to meet thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the black-bear sneak upon thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Pohyola’s darksome portals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hundreds in their jaws have perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have devoured a thousand heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherefore will they not destroy thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since thy form is unprotected?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let them eat the gentle lambkins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed upon their tender tissues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They cannot devour this hero;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am girded with my buckler,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Girded with my belt of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Armlets wear I of the master,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the wolf and bear protected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not hasten to Untamo.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can meet the wolf of Lempo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the bear I have a balsam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his mouth I conjure bridles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the wolf, forge chains of iron;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will smite them as the willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chop them into little fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus I’ll gain the open court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus triumphant end my journey.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then thy journey is not ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Greater dangers still await thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great the wonders yet before thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Horrors three within thy pathway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three great dangers of the hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still await thy reckless footsteps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the worst of all thy dangers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thou hast still farther wandered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wilt reach the Court of Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the walls are forged from iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from steel the outer bulwark;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rises from the earth to heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back again to earth returning;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Double spears are used for railings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On each spear are serpents winding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On each rail are stinging adders;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lizards too adorn the bulwarks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Play their long tails in the sunlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hissing lizards, venomed serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Jump and writhe upon the rampart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn their horrid heads to meet thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the greensward lie the monsters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the ground the things of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their pliant tongues of venom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hissing, striking, crawling, writhing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One more horrid than the others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lies before the fatal gate-way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Longer than the longest rafters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Larger than the largest portals;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hisses with the tongue of anger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifts his head in awful menace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raises it to strike none other</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than the hero of the islands.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the warlike Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“By such things the children perish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such is not the death of heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know I well the fire to manage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can quench the flames of passion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can meet the prowling wild-beasts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can appease the wrath of serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can heal the sting of adders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have plowed the serpent-pastures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plowed the adder-fields of Northland;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While my hands were unprotected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held the serpents in my fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drove the adders to Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On my hands the blood of serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On my feet the fat of adders.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never will thy hero stumble</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the serpents of the Northland;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my heel I’ll crush the monsters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stamp the horrid things to atoms;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will banish them from Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive them to Manala’s kingdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Step within Pohyola’s mansion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walk the halls of Sariola!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do not go, my son beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the firesides of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the Northland fields and fallows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There are warriors with broadswords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heroes clad in mail of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are on beer intoxicated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the beer are much embittered;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They will charm thee, hapless creature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the tips of swords of magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Greater heroes have been conjured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stronger ones have been outwitted.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Formerly thy son resided</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hamlets of Pohyola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laplanders cannot enchant me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the Turyalanders harm me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I the Laplander will conjure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charm him with my magic powers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing his shoulders wide asunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his chin I’ll sing a fissure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing his collar-bone to pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing his breast to thousand fragments.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Foolish son, ungrateful wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boasting of thy former visit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boasting of thy fatal journey!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once in Northland thou wert living,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the homesteads of Pohyola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There thou tried to swim the whirlpool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tasted there the dog-tongue waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Floated down the fatal current,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sank beneath its angry billows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast seen Tuoni’s river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast measured Mana’s waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to-day thou wouldst be sleeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had it not been for thy mother!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What I tell thee well remember,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou gain Pohyola’s chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled with stakes thou’lt find the court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These to hold the heads of heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There thy head will rest forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou go to Sariola.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the warlike Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fools indeed may heed thy counsel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cowards too may give attention;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those of seven conquest-summers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot heed such weak advising.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring to me my battle-armor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring my magic mail of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me too my father’s broadsword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep the old man’s blade from rusting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long it has been cold and idle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long has lain in secret places,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long and constantly been weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long been asking for a bearer.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he took his mail of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took his ancient battle-armor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took his father’s sword of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tried its point against the oak-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tried its edge upon the sorb-tree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his hand the blade was bended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the limber boughs of willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the juniper in summer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There is none in Pohya’s hamlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the courts of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That with me can measure broadswords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can meet this blade ancestral.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the nail he took a cross-bow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took the strongest from the rafters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in meditation:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I shall recognize as worthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Recognize that one a hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can bend this mighty cross-bow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can break its magic sinews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hamlets of Pohyola.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen, filled with courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Girds himself in suit of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dons his mighty mail of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his servant speaks as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Trusty slave, and whom I purchased,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom I bought with gold and silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick prepare my fiery charger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harness well my steed of battle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am going to the feasting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the banquet-fields of Lempo.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick obeys the faithful servant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hitches well the noble war-horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick prepares the fire-red stallion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words when all is I ready:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have done what thou hast hidden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ready harnessed is the charger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting to obey his master.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Comes the hour of the departing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the hero, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right hand ready, left unwilling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All his anxious fingers pain him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till at last in full obedience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All his members give permission;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Starts the hero on his journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the mother gives him counsel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the threshold of the dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the highway of the court-yard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Child of courage, my beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Son of strength, my wisdom-hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou goest to the feasting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou reach the great carousal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drink thou only a half a cupful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drink the goblet to the middle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always give the half remaining,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give the worse half to another,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To another more unworthy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the lower half are serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worms, and frogs, and hissing lizards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feeding on the slimy bottom.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Furthermore she tells her hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives her son these sage directions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the border of the court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the portals farthest distant:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If thou goest to the banquet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou reach the great carousal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Occupy but half the settle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take but half a stride in walking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give the second half to others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To another less deserving;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only thus thou’lt be a hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus become a son immortal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the guest-rooms look courageous,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bravely move about the chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the gatherings of heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the hosts of magic valor.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly leaped upon the cross-bench</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his battle-sledge of wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raised his pearl-enamelled birch-rod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snapped his whip above his charger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the steed flew onward fleetly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Galloped on his distant journey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He had travelled little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a flight of hazel-chickens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick arose before his coming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew before the foaming racer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There were left some feathers lying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feathers of the hazel-chickens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lying in the hero’s pathway.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the reckless Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathered for their magic virtues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put them in his pouch of leather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not know what things might happen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his journey to Pohyola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All things have some little value,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a strait all things are useful.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he drove a little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Galloped farther on the highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When his courser neighed in danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the fleet-foot ceased his running.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the stout-heart, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose upon his seat in wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Craned his neck and looked about him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found it as his mother told him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found a stream of fire opposing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran the fire-stream like a river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran across the hero’s pathway.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the river was a fire-fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the cataract a fire-rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the rock a fiery hillock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On its summit perched an eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his throat the fire was streaming</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the crater far below him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire out-shooting from his feathers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glowing with a fiery splendor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long he looked upon the hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long he gazed on Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the eagle thus addressed him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whither art thou driving, Ahti,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither going, Lemminkainen?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kaukomieli spake in answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To the feastings of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the drinking-halls of Louhi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the banquet of her people;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Move aside and let me journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Move a little from my pathway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let this wanderer pass by thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am warlike Lemminkainen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This the answer of the eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Screaming from his throat of splendor:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Though thou art wild Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall let thee wander onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through my fire-throat let thee journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through these flames shall be thy passage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the banquet-halls of Louhi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Pohyola’s great carousal!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Little heeding, Kaukomieli</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thinks himself in little trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrusts his fingers in his pockets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Searches in his pouch of leather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly takes the magic feathers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feathers from the hazel-chickens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rubs them into finest powder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rubs them with his magic fingers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence a flight of birds arises,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hazel-chickens from the feathers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Large the bevy of the young birds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the wizard, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drives them to the eagle’s fire-mouth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to satisfy his hunger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to quench the fire out-streaming.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus escapes the reckless hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus escapes the first of dangers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Passes thus the first destroyer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his journey to Pohyola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With his whip he strikes his courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his birch-whip, pearl-enamelled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway speeds the fiery charger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Noiselessly upon his journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gallops fast and gallops faster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the flying steed in terror</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neighs again and ceases running.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen, quickly rising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cranes his neck and looks about him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees his mother’s words were truthful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees her augury well-taken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! before him yawned a fire-gulf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stretching crosswise through his pathway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far to east the gulf extending,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the west an endless distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled with stones and burning pebbles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Running streams of burning matter.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Little heeding, Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cries aloud in prayer to Ukko:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ukko, thou O God above me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dear Creator, omnipresent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the north-west send a storm-cloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the east, dispatch a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the south send forth a third one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let them gather from the south-west,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sew their edges well together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill thou well the interspaces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send a snow-fall high as heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let it fall from upper ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall upon the flaming fire-pit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the cataract and whirlpool!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mighty Ukko, the Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ukko, father omnipresent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dwelling in the courts of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent a storm-cloud from the north-west,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the east he sent a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the south despatched a third one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let them gather from the south-west,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sewed their edges well together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled their many interspaces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent a snow-fall high as heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the giddy heights of ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent it seething to the fire-pit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the streams of burning matter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the snow-fall in the fire-pond,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grows a lake with rolling billows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the hero, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conjures there of ice a passage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From one border to the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus escapes his second danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus his second trouble passes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the reckless Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raised his pearl-enamelled birch-rod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snapped his whip above his racer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the steed flew onward swiftly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Galloped on his distant journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the highway to Pohyola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Galloped fast and galloped faster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Galloped on a greater distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the stallion loudly neighing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stopped and trembled on the highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the lively Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raised himself upon the cross-bench,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked to see what else had happened;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! a wolf stands at the portals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the passage-way a black-bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the high-gate of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the ending of the journey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon young Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handsome hero, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrusts his fingers in his pockets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeks his magic pouch of leather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pulls therefrom a lock of ewe-wool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rubs it firmly in his fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his hands it falls to powder;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathes the breath of life upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a flock of sheep arises,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goats and sheep of sable color;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the flock the black-wolf pounces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wild-bear aids the slaughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the reckless Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rushes by them on his journey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gallops on a little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the court of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds the fence of molten iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of steel the rods and pickets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the earth a hundred fathoms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the azure sky, a thousand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Double-pointed spears projecting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On each spear were serpents twisted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adders coiled in countless numbers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lizards mingled with the serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tails entangled pointing earthward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While their heads were skyward whirling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Writhing, hissing mass of evil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the stout-heart, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeply thought and long considered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“It is as my mother told me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the wall that she predicted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stretching from the earth to heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Downward deep are serpents creeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeper still the rails extending;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High as highest flight of eagles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Higher still the wall shoots upward.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the hero, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Little cares, nor feels disheartened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Draws his broadsword from its scabbard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Draws his mighty blade ancestral,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hews the wall with might of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks the palisade in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hews to atoms seven pickets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chops the serpent-wall to fragments;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the breach he quickly passes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the portals of Pohyola.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the way, a serpent lying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lying crosswise in the entry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Longer than the longest rafters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Larger than the posts of oak-wood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hundred-eyed, the heinous serpent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a thousand tongues, the monster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eyes as large as sifting vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tongues as long as shafts of javelins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Teeth as large as hatchet-handles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back as broad as skiffs of ocean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen does not venture</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway through this host opposing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the hundred heads of adders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the thousand tongues of serpents.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the magic Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Venomed viper, thing of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient adder of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou that crawlest in the stubble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the flower-roots of Lempo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who has sent thee from thy kingdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent thee from thine evil coverts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent thee hither, crawling, writhing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the pathway I would travel?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who bestowed thy mouth of venom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who insisted, who commanded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shouldst raise thy head toward heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who thy tail has given action?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was this given by the father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did the mother give this power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the eldest of the brothers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or the youngest of the sisters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or some other of thy kindred?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Close thy mouth, thou thing of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hide thy pliant tongue of venom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a circle wrap thy body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coil thou like a shield in silence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give to me one-half the pathway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let this wanderer pass by thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or remove thyself entirely;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Get thee hence to yonder heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick retreat to bog and stubble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hide thyself in reeds and rushes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the brambles of the lowlands.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a ball of flax enfolding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a sphere of aspen-branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thy head and tail together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roll thyself to yonder mountain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the heather is thy dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Underneath the sod thy caverns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou raise thy head in anger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mighty Ukko will destroy it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pierce it with his steel-tipped arrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his death-balls made of iron!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hardly had the hero ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the monster, little heeding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hissing with his tongue in anger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plying like the forked lightning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pounces with his mouth of venom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the head of Lemminkainen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the hero, quick recalling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks the master-words of knowledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Words that came from distant ages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Words his ancestors had taught him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Words his mother learned in childhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Since thou wilt not heed mine order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since thou wilt not leave the highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Puffed with pride of thine own greatness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shall burst in triple pieces.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave thy station for the borders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will hunt thine ancient mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing thine origin of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How arose thy head of horror;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suoyatar, thine ancient mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thing of evil, thy creator!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Suoyatar once let her spittle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall upon the waves of ocean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This was rocked by winds and waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shaken by the ocean-currents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Six years rocked upon the billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocked in water seven summers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue-back of the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the billows high as heaven;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lengthwise did the billows draw it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sunshine gave it softness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the shore the billows washed it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the coast the waters left it.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then appeared Creation’s daughters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three the daughters thus appearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the roaring shore of ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There beheld the spittle lying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the daughters spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘What would happen from this spittle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should the breath of the Creator</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall upon the writhing matter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathe the breath of life upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give the thing the sense of vision?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The Creator heard these measures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake himself the words that follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Evil only comes from evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is the expectoration</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of fell Suoyatar, its mother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore would the thing be evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should I breathe a soul within it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should I give it sense of vision.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hisi heard this conversation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever ready with his mischief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made himself to be creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathed a soul into the spittle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fell Suoyatar’s fierce anger.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus arose the poison-monster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus was born the evil serpent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the origin of evil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Whence the life that gave her action’?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the carbon-pile of Hisi.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence then was her heart created?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the heart-throbs of her mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence arose her brain of evil?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the foam of rolling waters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence was consciousness awakened?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the waterfall’s commotion.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence arose her head of venom?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the seed-germs of the ivy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence then came her eyes of fury?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the flaxen seeds of Lempo.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence the evil ears for hearing?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the foliage of Hisi.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence then was her mouth created?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This from Suoyatar’s foam-currents</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence arose thy tongue of anger r</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the spear of Keitolainen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence arose thy fangs of poison?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the teeth of Mana’s daughter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence then was thy back created?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the carbon-posts of Piru.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How then was thy tail created?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the brain of the hobgoblin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence arose thy writhing entrails?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the death-belt of Tuoni.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This thine origin, O Serpent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This thy charm of evil import,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vilest thing of God’s creation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Writhing, hissing thing of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the color of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the shade of earth and heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the darkness of the storm-cloud.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Get thee hence, thou loathsome monster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clear the pathway of this hero.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am mighty Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On my journey to Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the feastings and carousals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the halls of darksome Northland.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the snake uncoiling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hundred-eyed and heinous monster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crawled away to other portals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the hero, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might proceed upon his errand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dismal Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the feastings and carousals</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the banquet-halls of Pohya.</span>
