			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen, hero-blacksmith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal metal-worker,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens forward to the court-room</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the master of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens through the open portals</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into Louhi’s home and presence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Servants come with silver pitchers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled with Northland’s richest brewing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Honey-drink is brought and offered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the blacksmith of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen thus replying:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I shall not in all my life-time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taste the drink that thou hast brought me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till I see the Maid of Beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairy Maiden of the Rainbow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will drink with her in gladness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For whose hand I journey hither.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Trouble does the one selected</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give to him that wooes and watches;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not yet are her feet in sandals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine affianced is not ready.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only canst thou woo my daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only canst thou win the maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thou hast by aid of magic</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plowed the serpent-field of Hisi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plowed the field of hissing vipers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touching neither beam nor handles.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once this field was plowed by Piru,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lempo furrowed it with horses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a plowshare made of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a beam of flaming iron;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never since has any hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought this field to cultivation.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen of Wainola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway hastens to the chamber</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Maiden of the Rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words in hesitation:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou of Night and Dawn the daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me, dost thou not remember</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When for thee I forged the Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hammered thee the lid in colors?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou didst swear by oath the strougest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the forge and by the anvil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the tongs and by the hammer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the ears of the Almighty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And before omniscient Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wouldst follow me hereafter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be my bride, my life-companion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be my honored wife forever.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now thy mother is exacting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not give to me her daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till by means of magic only,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have plowed the field of serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plowed the hissing soil of Hisi.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The affianced Bride of Beauty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives this answer to the suitor:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O, thou blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal wonder-forger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge thyself a golden plowshare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge the beam of shining silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of copper forge the handles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then with ease, by aid of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst plow the field of serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plow the hissing soil of Hisi.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen, welcome suitor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway builds a forge and smithy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Places gold within the furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the forge he lays the silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forges then a golden plowshare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forges, too, a beam of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forges handles out of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forges boots and gloves of iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forges him a mail of metal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his limbs a safe protection,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Safe protection for his body.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then a horse of fire selecting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harnesses the flaming stallion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goes to plow the field of serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plow the viper-lands of Hisi.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the field were countless vipers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Serpents there of every species,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crawling, writhing, hissing, stinging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harmless all against the hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus he stills the snakes of Lempo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Vipers, ye by God created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither best nor worst of creatures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye whose wisdom comes from Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whose venom comes from Hisi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ukko is your greater Master,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By His will your heads are lifted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Get ye hence before my plowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Writ-he ye through the grass and stubble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crawl ye to the nearest thicket,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep your heads beneath the heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hunt our holes to Mana’s kingdom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If your poison-heads be lifted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will mighty Ukko smite them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘With his iron-pointed arrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the lightning of his anger.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Safely plows the field of serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifts the vipers in his plowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Buries them beneath the furrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harmless all against his magic.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the task had been completed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen, quick returning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed Pohyola’s hostess:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have plowed the field of Hisi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plowed the field of hissing serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stilled and banished all the vipers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give me, ancient dame, thy daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest maiden of the Northland.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Shall not grant to thee my daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall not give my lovely virgin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Tuoni’s bear is muzzled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Manala’s wolf is conquered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the forests of the Death-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the boundaries of Mana.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hundreds have been sent to hunt him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So one yet has been successful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All have perished in Manala.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon young Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the maiden’s chamber hastens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addresses his affianced:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Still another test demanded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must go to Tuonela,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bridle there the bear of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring him from the Death-land forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Tuoni’s grove and empire!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This advice the maiden gives him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou artist, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal metal-worker,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge of steel a magic bridle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a rock beneath the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the foaming triple currents;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the straps of steel and copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bridle then the bear of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead him from Tuoni’s forests.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forged of steel a magic bridle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a rock beneath the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the foam of triple currents;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the straps of steel and copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway went the bear to muzzle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the forests of the Death-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in supplication:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Terhenetar, ether-maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Daughter of the fog and snow-flake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sift the fog and let it settle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the bills and lowland thickets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the wild-bear feeds and lingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he may not see my coming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not hear my stealthy footsteps!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Terhenetar hears his praying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes the fog and snow-flake settle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the coverts of the wild-beasts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the bear he safely bridles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fetters him in chains of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the forests of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the blue groves of Manala.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When this task had been completed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen, quick returning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed the ancient Louhi:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Give me, worthy dame, thy daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give me now my bride affianced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have brought the bear of Mana</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Tuoni’s fields and forests.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the blacksmith, Ilmarinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will only give my daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give to thee the Maid of Beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the monster-pike thou catchest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the river of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Manala’s fatal waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Using neither hooks, nor fish-nets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither boat, nor fishing-tackle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hundreds have been sent to catch him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one yet has been successful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All have perished in Manala.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much disheartened, Ilmarinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to the maiden’s chamber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed the rainbow-maiden:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now a third test is demanded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Much more difficult than ever;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must catch the pike of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the river of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And without my fishing-tackle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard the third test of the hero!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This advice the maiden gives him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou hero, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never, never be discouraged:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy furnace, forge an eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fire of ancient magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will catch the pike of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Catch the monster-fish in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the death-stream of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Manala’s fatal waters.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the suitor, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eternal artist-forgeman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the furnace forged an eagle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fire of ancient wisdom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this giant bird of magic</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forged he talons out of iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his beak of steel and copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seats himself upon the eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his back between the wing-bones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addresses he his creature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives the bird of fire, this order:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mighty eagle, bird of beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly thou whither I direct thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Tuoni’s coal-black river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the blue deeps of the Death-stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seize the mighty fish of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Catch for me this water-monster.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swiftly flies the magic eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Giant-bird of worth and wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the river of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to catch the pike of Mana;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One wing brushes on the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the other sweeps the heavens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the ocean dips his talons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whets his beak on mountain-ledges.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Safely landing, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The immortal artist-forger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hunts the monster of the Death-stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the eagle hunts and fishes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the waters of Manala.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the river rose a monster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grasped the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tried to drag him to his sea-cave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the eagle pounced upon him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his metal-beak he seized him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrenched his head, and rent his body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurled him back upon the bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the deep and fatal river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Freed his master, Ilmarinen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then arose the pike of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came the water-dog in silence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the pikes was not the largest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor belonged he to the smallest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tongue the length of double hatchets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Teeth as long as fen-rake handles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mouth as broad as triple streamlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back as wide as seven sea-boats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tried to snap the magic blacksmith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tried to swallow Ilmarinen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swiftly swoops the mighty eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the birds was not the largest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor belonged he to the smallest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mouth as wide as seven streamlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tongue as long as seven javelins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like five crooked scythes his talons;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swoops upon the pike of Mana.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the giant fish endangered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Darts and flounders in the river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dragging down the mighty eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lashing up the very bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the surface of the river;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the mighty bird uprising</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaves the wounded pike in water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soars aloft on worsted pinions</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his home in upper ether;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soars awhile, and sails, and circles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Circles o’er the reddened waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swoops again on lightning-pinions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes with mighty force his talons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the shoulder of his victim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes the second of his talons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the flinty mountain-ledges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the rocks with iron hardened;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the cliffs rebound his talons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slip the flinty rocks o’erhanging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the monster-pike resisting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dives again beneath the surface</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bottom of the river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the talons of the eagle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep, the wounds upon the body</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the monster of Tuoni.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still a third time soars the eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soars, and sails, and quickly circles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swoops again upon the monster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire out-shooting from his pinoins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both his eyeballs flashing lightning;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his beak of steel and copper</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grasps again the pike of Mana</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Firmly planted are his talons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the rocks and in his victim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drags the monster from the river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifts the pike above the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Tuoni’s coal-black river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the blue-back of Manala.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the third time does the eagle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring success from former failures;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus at last the eagle catches</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mana’s pike, the worst of fishes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swiftest swimmer of the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the river of Tuoni;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None could see Manala’s river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the myriad of fish-scales;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hardly could one see through ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the feathers of the eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Relicts of the mighty contest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the bird of copper talons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took the pike, with scales of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the pine-tree’s topmost branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the fir-tree plumed with needles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tore the monster-fish in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ate the body of his victim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left the head for Ilmarinen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the blacksmith to the eagle:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou bird of evil nature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What thy thought and what thy motive?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast eaten what I needed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evidence of my successes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thoughtless eagle, witless instinct,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to mar the spoils of conquest!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the bird of metal talons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened onward, soaring upward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rising higher into ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rising, flying, soaring, sailing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the borders of the long-clouds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the vault of ether tremble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Split apart the dome of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broke the colored bow of Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tore the Moon-horns from their sockets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disappeared beyond the Sun-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the home of the triumphant.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the blacksmith, Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took the pike-head to the hostess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the ever-dismal Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed the ancient Louhi:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let this head forever serve thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a guest-bench for thy dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evidence of hero-triumphs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have caught the pike of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have done as thou demandest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three my victories in Death-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three the tests of magic heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou give me now thy daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give to me the Maid of Beauty?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Badly is the test accomplished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou has torn the pike in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his neck the head is severed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his body thou hast eaten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought to me this worthless relic!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Ilmarinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“When the victory is greatest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do we suffer greatest losses!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the river of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the kingdom of Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have brought to thee this trophy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the third task is completed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me is the maiden ready,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou give the bride affianced?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will give to thee my daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will prepare my snow-white virgin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the suitor, Ilmarinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast won the Maid of Beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bride is she of thine hereafter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fit companion of thy fireside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Help and joy of all thy lifetime.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the floor a child was sitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the babe this tale related.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There appeared within this dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came a bird within the castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the East came flying hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the East, a monstrous eagle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One wing touched the vault of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the other swept the ocean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his tail upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reached his beak beyond the cloudlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked about, and eager watching,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew around, and sailing, soaring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew away to hero-castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knocked three times with beak of copper</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the castle-roof of iron;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the eagle could not enter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then the eagle, looking round him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew again, and sailed, and circled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew then to the mothers’ castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loudly rapped with heavy knocking</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the mothers’ roof of copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the eagle could not enter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then the eagle, looking round him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew a third time, sailing, soaring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew then to the virgins’ castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knocked again with beak of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the virgins’ roof of linen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Easy for him there to enter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew upon the castle-chimney,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick descending to the chamber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pulled the clapboards from the studding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tore the linen from the rafters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perched upon the chamber-window,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the walls of many colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the cross-bars gaily-feathered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked upon the curly-beaded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked upon their golden ringlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked upon the snow-white virgins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the purest of the maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the fairest of the daughters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the maid with pearly necklace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the maiden wreathed in flowers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perched awhile, and looked, admiring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swooped upon the Maid of Beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the purest of the virgins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the whitest, on the fairest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the stateliest and grandest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swooped upon the rainbow-daughter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the dismal Sariola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grasped her in his mighty talons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bore away the Maid of Beauty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maid of fairest form and feature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maid adorned with pearly necklace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Decked in feathers iridescent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fragrant flowers upon her bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarlet band around her forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden rings upon her fingers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest maiden of the Northland.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the babe his tale had ended:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tell me bow, my child beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast learned about the maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast obtained the information,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How her flaxen ringlets nestled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the maiden’s silver glistened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the virgin’s gold was lauded.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shone the silver Sun upon thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did the moonbeams bring this knowledge?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the floor the child made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thus I gained the information,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moles of good-luck led me hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the home, of the distinguished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the guest-room of the maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good-name bore her worthy father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He that sailed the magic vessel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better-name enjoyed the mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She that baked the bread of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She that kneaded wheaten biscuits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fed her many guests in Northland.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thus the information reached me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the distant stranger heard it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the virgin had arisen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once I walked within the court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stepping near the virgin’s chamber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At an early hour of morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the Sun had broken slumber</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whirling rose the soot in cloudlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blackened wreaths of smoke came rising</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the chamber of the maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From thy daughter’s lofty chimney;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the maid was busy grinding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moved the handles of the millstone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making voices like the cuckoo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the ducks the side-holes sounded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sifter like the goldfinch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the sea-pearls sang the grindstones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then a second time I wandered</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the border of the meadow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the forest was the maiden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocking on a fragrant hillock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dyeing red in iron vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in copper kettles, yellow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then a third time did I wander</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the lovely maiden’s window;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There I saw thy daughter weaving,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the flying of her shuttle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the beating of her loom-lathe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the rattling of her treddles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the whirring of her yarn-reel.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now alas! beloved daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have often taught this lesson:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Do not sing among the pine-trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not call adown the valleys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not hang thy head in walking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not bare thine arms, nor shoulders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep the secrets of thy bosom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hide thy beauty and thy power.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This I told thee in the autumn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taught thee in the summer season,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang thee in the budding spring-time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang thee when the snows were falling:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Let us build a place for hiding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us build the smallest windows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where may weave my fairest daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my maid may ply her shuttle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where my joy may work unnoticed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the heroes of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the suitors of Wainola.’”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the floor the child made answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fourteen days the young child numbered;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Easy ’tis to hide a war-horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Northland fields and stables;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard indeed to hide a maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Having lovely form and features!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Build of stone a distant castle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the middle of the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep within thy lovely maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Train thou there thy winsome daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not long hidden canst thou keep her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maidens will not grow and flourish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kept apart from men and heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not live without their suitors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not thrive without their wooers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst never hide a maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither on the land nor water.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Head down-bent and heavy-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanders to his native country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Wainola’s peaceful meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the plains of Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chanting as he journeys homeward:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have passed the age for wooing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woe is me, rejected suitor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woe is me, a witless minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I did not woo and marry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When my face was young and winsome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When my hand was warm and welcome!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Youth dethrones my age and station,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wealth is nothing, wisdom worthless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a hero goes a-wooing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a poor but younger brother.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fatal error that a hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not wed in early manhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his youth does not be master</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a worthy wife and household.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the ancient Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sends the edict to his people:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Old men must not go a-wooing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must not swim the sea of anger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must not row upon a wager,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must not run a race for glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the younger sons of Northland.”</span>
