				<p epub:type="title">Lemminkainen’s Second Wooing</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the ancient Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Give to me thy lovely daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me now thy winsome maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring the best of Lapland virgins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest virgin of the Northland.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answered thus the wild magician:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I shall never give my daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never give my fairest maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the best one, nor the worst one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the largest, nor the smallest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast now one wife-companion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou has taken hence one hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carried off the fair Kyllikki.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This is Lemminkainen’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To my home I took Kyllikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my cottage on the island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my entry-gates and kindred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now I wish a better hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway bring thy fairest daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worthiest of all thy virgins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest maid with sable tresses.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Never will I give my daughter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a hero false and worthless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a minstrel vain and evil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore, pray thou for my maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore, woo the sweet-faced flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When thou bringest me the wild-moose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the Hisi fields and forests.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the artful Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deftly whittled out his javelins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly made his leathern bow-string,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And prepared his bow and arrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soliloquized as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now my javelins are made ready,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my arrows too are ready,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my oaken crossbow bended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But my snow-shoes are not builded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will make me worthy snow-shoes?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen, grave and thoughtful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long reflected, well considered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the snow-shoes could be fashioned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who the artist that could make them;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to the Kauppi-smithy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the smithy of Lylikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus addressed the snow-shoe artist:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou skilful Woyalander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kauppi, ablest smith of Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make me quick two worthy snow-shoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smooth them well and make them hardy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in Tapio the wild-moose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roaming through the Hisi-forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I may catch and bring to Louhi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a dowry for her daughter.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Lylikki thus made answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kauppi gave this prompt decision:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lemminkainen, reckless minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wilt hunt in vain the wild-moose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wilt catch but pain and torture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Hisi fens and forests.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Little heeding, Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these measures to Lylikki:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Make for me the worthy snow-shoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly work and make them ready;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go I will and catch the blue-moose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where in Tapio it browses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Hisi woods and snow-fields.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Lylikki, snow-shoe-maker,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient Kauppi, master artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whittled in the fall his show-shoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smoothed them in the winter evenings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One day working on the runners,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the next day making stick-rings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till at last the shoes were finished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the workmanship was perfect.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he fastened well the shoe-straps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smooth as adder’s skin the woodwork,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soft as fox-fur were the stick-rings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oiled he well his wondrous snow-shoes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the tallow of the reindeer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When he thus soliloquizes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the accents of Lylikki:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is there any youth in Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Any in this generation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can travel in these snow-shoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can move the lower sections?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of hope, and life, and vigor:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Surely there is one in Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this rising generation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can travel in these snow-shoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the right and left can manage.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To his back he tied the quiver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Placed the bow upon his shoulder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With both hands he grasped his snow-cane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaking meanwhile words as follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There is nothing in the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing in the world of Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing underneath the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the uplands, in the lowlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing in the snow-fields running,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a fleet deer of the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That could not be overtaken</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the snow-shoes of Lylikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the strides of Lemminkainen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wicked Hisi heard these measures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Juutas listened to their echoes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway Hisi called the wild-moose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Juutas fashioned soon a reindeer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the head was made of punk-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Horns of naked willow branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feet were furnished by the rushes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the legs, by reeds aquatic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Veins were made of withered grasses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eyes, from daisies of the meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ears were formed of water-flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the skin of tawny fir-bark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of sappy wood, the muscles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair and fleet, the magic reindeer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Juutas thus instructs the wild-moose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of wicked Hisi:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Flee away, thou moose of Juutas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flee away, thou Hisi-reindeer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the winds, thou rapid courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the snow-homes of the ranger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the ridges of the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the snow-capped hills of Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy hunter may be worn out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy pursuer be tormented,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen be exhausted.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the Hisi-reindeer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Juutas-moose with branching antlers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fleetly ran through fen and forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over Lapland’s hills and valleys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the open fields and court-yards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the penthouse doors and gate-ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turning over tubs of water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threw the kettles from the fire-pole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And upset the dishes cooking.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then arose a fearful uproar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the court-yards of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lapland-dogs began their barking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lapland-children cried in terror,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lapland-women roared with laughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Lapland-heroes shouted.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fleetly followed Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Followed fast, and followed faster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened on behind the wild-moose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over swamps and through the woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over snow-fields vast and pathless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over high uprising mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire outshooting from his runners,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smoke arising from his snow-cane:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could not hear the wild-moose bounding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could not sight the flying fleet-foot;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glided on through field and forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glided over lakes and rivers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over lands beyond the smooth-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the desert plains of Hisi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glided o’er the plains of Kalma,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the kingdom of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the end of Kalma’s empire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the jaws of Death stand open,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the head of Kalma lowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ready to devour the stranger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To devour wild Lemminkainen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Tuoni cannot reach him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kalma cannot overtake him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Distant woods are yet untraveled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far away a woodland corner</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stands unsearched by Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the North’s extensive borders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the realm of dreary Lapland.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the hero, on his snow-shoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens to the distant woodlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to hunt the moose of Piru.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he nears the woodland corner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There he hears a frightful uproar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the Northland’s distant borders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the dreary fields of Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hears the dogs as they are barking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hears the children loudly screaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hears the laughter of the women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hears the shouting of the heroes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon wild Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens forward on his snow-shoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the place where dogs are barking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the distant woods of Lapland.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the reckless Kaukomieli</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had approached this Hisi corner,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway he began to question:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why this laughter of the women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why the screaming of the children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why the shouting of the heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why this barking of the watch-dogs?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This reply was promptly given:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This the reason for this uproar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Women laughing, children screaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heroes shouting, watch-dogs barking:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hisi’s moose came running hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither came the Piru-Reindeer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither came with hoofs of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the open fields and court-yards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the penthouse doors and gate-ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turning over tubs of water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threw the kettles from the fire-pole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And upset the dishes cooking.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway summoned all his courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pushed ahead his mighty snow-shoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swift as adders in the stubble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Levelled bushes in the marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the swift and fiery serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words of magic import,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keeping balance with his snow-staff:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come thou might of Lapland heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring to me the moose of Juutas;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come thou strength of Lapland-women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And prepare the boiling cauldron;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, thou might of Lapland children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring together fire and fuel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, thou strength of Lapland-kettles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Help to boil the Hisi wild-moose.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then with mighty force and courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen hastened onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Striking backward, shooting forward;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a long sweep of his snow-shoe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disappeared from view the hero;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the second, shooting further,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was the hunter out of hearing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the third the hero glided</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the shoulders of the wild-moose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took a pole of stoutest oak-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took some bark-strings from the willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewithal to bind the moose-deer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bind him to his oaken hurdle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the moose he spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Here remain, thou moose of Juutas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skip about, my bounding courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my hurdle jump and frolic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Captive from the fields of Piru,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the Hisi glens and mountains.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he stroked the captured wild-moose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Patted him upon his forehead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake again in measured accents:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I would like awhile to linger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would love to rest a moment</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the cottage of my maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my virgin, young and lovely.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the Hisi-moose grew angry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stamped his feet and shook his antlers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words to Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Surely Lempo soon will got thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou sit beside the maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldst thou linger by the virgin.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the wild-moose stamps and rushes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tears in two the bands of willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks the oak-wood pole in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And upturns the hunter’s hurdle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly leaping from his captor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bounds away with strength of freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over hills and over lowlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over swamps and over snow-fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over mountains clothed in heather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the eye may not behold him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the hero’s ear detect him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the mighty hunter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Angry grows, and much disheartened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Starts again the moose to capture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gliding off behind the courser.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his might he plunges forward;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the instep breaks his snow-shoe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks the runners into fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the mountings breaks his javelins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the centre breaks his snow-staff,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the moose bounds on before him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the Hisi-woods and snow-fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of reach of Lemminkainen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the reckless Kaukomieli</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked with bended head, ill-humored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One by one upon the fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaking words of ancient wisdom:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Northland hunters, never, never,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go defiant to thy forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Hisi vales and mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to hunt the moose of Juutas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like this senseless, reckless hero;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have wrecked my magic snow-shoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ruined too my useful snow-staff,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my javelins I have broken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the wild-moose runs in safety</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the Hisi fields and forests.”</span>
