<p>Spake the ancient Lemminkainen<br/>
To the hostess of Pohyola:<br/>
“Give to me thy lovely daughter,<br/>
Bring me now thy winsome maiden,<br/>
Bring the best of Lapland virgins,<br/>
Fairest virgin of the Northland.”<br/>
Louhi, hostess of Pohyola,<br/>
Answered thus the wild magician:<br/>
“I shall never give my daughter,<br/>
Never give my fairest maiden,<br/>
Not the best one, nor the worst one,<br/>
Not the largest, nor the smallest;<br/>
Thou hast now one wife-companion,<br/>
Thou has taken hence one hostess,<br/>
Carried off the fair Kyllikki.”<br/>
This is Lemminkainen’s answer:<br/>
To my home I took Kyllikki,<br/>
To my cottage on the island,<br/>
To my entry-gates and kindred;<br/>
Now I wish a better hostess,<br/>
Straightway bring thy fairest daughter,<br/>
Worthiest of all thy virgins,<br/>
Fairest maid with sable tresses.”<br/>
Spake the hostess of Pohyola:<br/>
“Never will I give my daughter<br/>
To a hero false and worthless,<br/>
To a minstrel vain and evil;<br/>
Therefore, pray thou for my maiden,<br/>
Therefore, woo the sweet-faced flower,<br/>
When thou bringest me the wild-moose<br/>
From the Hisi fields and forests.”<br/>
Then the artful Lemminkainen<br/>
Deftly whittled out his javelins,<br/>
Quickly made his leathern bow-string,<br/>
And prepared his bow and arrows,<br/>
And soliloquized as follows:<br/>
“Now my javelins are made ready,<br/>
All my arrows too are ready,<br/>
And my oaken cross-bow bended,<br/>
But my snow-shoes are not builded,<br/>
Who will make me worthy snow-shoes?”<br/>
Lemminkainen, grave and thoughtful,<br/>
Long reflected, well considered,<br/>
Where the snow-shoes could be fashioned,<br/>
Who the artist that could make them;<br/>
Hastened to the Kauppi-smithy,<br/>
To the smithy of Lylikki,<br/>
Thus addressed the snow-shoe artist:<br/>
“O thou skilful Woyalander,<br/>
Kauppi, ablest smith of Lapland,<br/>
Make me quick two worthy snow-shoes,<br/>
Smooth them well and make them hardy,<br/>
That in Tapio the wild-moose,<br/>
Roaming through the Hisi-forests,<br/>
I may catch and bring to Louhi,<br/>
As a dowry for her daughter.”<br/>
Then Lylikki thus made answer,<br/>
Kauppi gave this prompt decision:<br/>
“Lemminkainen, reckless minstrel,<br/>
Thou wilt hunt in vain the wild-moose,<br/>
Thou wilt catch but pain and torture,<br/>
In the Hisi fens and forests.”<br/>
Little heeding, Lemminkainen<br/>
Spake these measures to Lylikki<br/>
“Make for me the worthy snow-shoes,<br/>
Quickly work and make them ready;<br/>
Go I will and catch the blue-moose<br/>
Where in Tapio it browses,<br/>
In the Hisi woods and snow-fields.”<br/>
Then Lylikki, snow-shoe-maker,<br/>
Ancient Kauppi, master artist,<br/>
Whittled in the fall his show-shoes,<br/>
Smoothed them in the winter evenings,<br/>
One day working on the runners,<br/>
All the next day making stick-rings,<br/>
Till at last the shoes were finished,<br/>
And the workmanship was perfect.<br/>
Then he fastened well the shoe-straps,<br/>
Smooth as adder’s skin the woodwork,<br/>
Soft as fox-fur were the stick-rings;<br/>
Oiled he well his wondrous snow-shoes<br/>
With the tallow of the reindeer;<br/>
When he thus soliloquizes,<br/>
These the accents of Lylikki:<br/>
“Is there any youth in Lapland,<br/>
Any in this generation,<br/>
That can travel in these snow-shoes,<br/>
That can move the lower sections?”<br/>
Spake the reckless Lemminkainen,<br/>
Full of hope, and life, and vigor:<br/>
Surely there is one in Lapland.<br/>
In this rising generation,<br/>
That can travel in these snow-shoes,<br/>
That the right and left can manage.”<br/>
To his back he tied the quiver,<br/>
Placed the bow upon his shoulder,<br/>
With both hands he grasped his snow-cane,<br/>
Speaking meanwhile words as follow:<br/>
“There is nothing in the woodlands,<br/>
Nothing in the world of Ukko,<br/>
Nothing underneath the heavens,<br/>
In the uplands, in the lowlands,<br/>
Nothing in the snow-fields running,<br/>
Not a fleet deer of the forest,<br/>
That could not be overtaken<br/>
With the snow-shoes of Lylikki,<br/>
With the strides of Lemminkainen.”<br/>
Wicked Hisi heard these measures,<br/>
Juntas listened to their echoes;<br/>
Straightway Hisi called the wild-moose,<br/>
Juutas fashioned soon a reindeer,<br/>
And the head was made of punk-wood,<br/>
Horns of naked willow branches,<br/>
Feet were furnished by the rushes,<br/>
And the legs, by reeds aquatic,<br/>
Veins were made of withered grasses,<br/>
Eyes, from daisies of the meadows,<br/>
Ears were formed of water-flowers,<br/>
And the skin of tawny fir-bark,<br/>
Out of sappy wood, the muscles,<br/>
Fair and fleet, the magic reindeer.<br/>
Juutas thus instructs the wild-moose,<br/>
These the words of wicked Hisi:<br/>
Flee away, thou moose of Juutas,<br/>
Flee away, thou Hisi-reindeer,<br/>
Like the winds, thou rapid courser,<br/>
To the snow-homes of the ranger,<br/>
To the ridges of the mountains,<br/>
To the snow-capped hills of Lapland,<br/>
That thy hunter may be worn out,<br/>
Thy pursuer be tormented,<br/>
Lemminkainen be exhausted.”<br/>
Thereupon the Hisi-reindeer,<br/>
Juutas-moose with branching antlers,<br/>
Fleetly ran through fen and forest,<br/>
Over Lapland’s hills and valleys,<br/>
Through the open fields and court-yards,<br/>
Through the penthouse doors and gate-ways,<br/>
Turning over tubs of water,<br/>
Threw the kettles from the fire-pole,<br/>
And upset the dishes cooking.<br/>
Then arose a fearful uproar,<br/>
In the court-yards of Pohyola,<br/>
Lapland-dogs began their barking,<br/>
Lapland-children cried in terror,<br/>
Lapland-women roared with laughter,<br/>
And the Lapland-heroes shouted.<br/>
Fleetly followed Lemminkainen,<br/>
Followed fast, and followed faster,<br/>
Hastened on behind the wild-moose,<br/>
Over swamps and through the woodlands,<br/>
Over snow-fields vast and pathless,<br/>
Over high uprising mountains,<br/>
Fire out-shooting from his runners,<br/>
Smoke arising from his snow-cane:<br/>
Could not hear the wild-moose bounding,<br/>
Could not sight the flying fleet-foot;<br/>
Glided on through field and forest,<br/>
Glided over lakes and rivers,<br/>
Over lands beyond the smooth-sea,<br/>
Through the desert plains of Hisi,<br/>
Glided o’er the plains of Kalma,<br/>
Through the kingdom of Tuoni,<br/>
To the end of Kalma’s empire,<br/>
Where the jaws of Death stand open,<br/>
Where the head of Kalma lowers,<br/>
Ready to devour the stranger,<br/>
To devour wild Lemminkainen;<br/>
But Tuoni cannot reach him,<br/>
Kalma cannot overtake him.<br/>
Distant woods are yet untraveled,<br/>
Far away a woodland corner<br/>
Stands unsearched by Kaukomieli,<br/>
In the North’s extensive, borders,<br/>
In the realm of dreary Lapland.<br/>
Now the hero, on his snow-shoes,<br/>
Hastens to the distant woodlands,<br/>
There to hunt the moose of Piru.<br/>
As he nears the woodland corner,<br/>
There he bears a frightful uproar,<br/>
From the Northland’s distant borders,<br/>
From the dreary fields of Lapland,<br/>
Hears the dogs as they are barking,<br/>
Hears the children loudly screaming,<br/>
Hears the laughter or the women,<br/>
Hears the shouting of the heroes.<br/>
Thereupon wild Lemminkainen<br/>
Hastens forward on his snow-shoes,<br/>
To the place where dogs are barking,<br/>
To the distant woods of Lapland.<br/>
When the reckless Kaukomieli<br/>
Had approached this Hisi corner,<br/>
Straightway he began to question:<br/>
“Why this laughter or the women,<br/>
Why the screaming of the children,<br/>
Why the shouting of the heroes,<br/>
Why this barking of the watch-dogs?<br/>
This reply was promptly given:<br/>
“This the reason for this uproar,<br/>
Women laughing, children screaming,<br/>
Heroes shouting, watch-dogs barking<br/>
Hisi’s moose came running hither,<br/>
Hither came the Piru-Reindeer,<br/>
Hither came with hoofs of silver,<br/>
Through the open fields and court-yards,<br/>
Through the penthouse doors and gate-ways,<br/>
Turning over tubs or water,<br/>
Threw the kettles from the fire-pole,<br/>
And upset the dishes cooking.”<br/>
Then the hero, Lemminkainen,<br/>
Straightway summoned all his courage,<br/>
Pushed ahead his mighty snow-shoes,<br/>
Swift as adders in the stubble,<br/>
Levelled bushes in the marshes,<br/>
Like the swift and fiery serpents,<br/>
Spake these words of magic import,<br/>
Keeping balance with his snow-staff:<br/>
Come thou might of Lapland heroes,<br/>
Bring to me the moose of Juutas;<br/>
Come thou strength of Lapland-women,<br/>
And prepare the boiling caldron;<br/>
Come, thou might of Lapland children,<br/>
Bring together fire and fuel;<br/>
Come, thou strength of Lapland-kettles,<br/>
Help to boil the Hisi wild-moose.”<br/>
Then with mighty force and courage,<br/>
Lemminkainen hastened onward,<br/>
Striking backward, shooting forward;<br/>
With a long sweep of his snow-shoe,<br/>
Disappeared from view the hero;<br/>
With the second, shooting further,<br/>
Was the hunter out of hearing,<br/>
With the third the hero glided<br/>
On the shoulders of the wild-moose;<br/>
Took a pole of stoutest oak-wood,<br/>
Took some bark-strings from the willow,<br/>
Wherewithal to bind the moose-deer,<br/>
Bind him to his oaken hurdle.<br/>
To the moose he spake as follows:<br/>
“Here remain, thou moose of Juutas<br/>
Skip about, my bounding courser,<br/>
In my hurdle jump and frolic,<br/>
Captive from the fields of Piru,<br/>
From the Hisi glens and mountains.”<br/>
Then he stroked the captured wild-moose,<br/>
Patted him upon his forehead,<br/>
Spake again in measured accents:<br/>
“I would like awhile to linger,<br/>
I would love to rest a moment<br/>
In the cottage of my maiden,<br/>
With my virgin, young and lovely.”<br/>
Then the Hisi-moose grew angry,<br/>
Stamped his feet and shook his antlers,<br/>
Spake these words to Lemminkainen:<br/>
“Surely Lempo soon will got thee,<br/>
Shouldst thou sit beside the maiden,<br/>
Shouldst thou linger by the virgin.”<br/>
Now the wild-moose stamps and rushes,<br/>
Tears in two the bands of willow,<br/>
Breaks the oak-wood pole in pieces,<br/>
And upturns the hunter’s hurdle,<br/>
Quickly leaping from his captor,<br/>
Bounds away with strength of freedom,<br/>
Over hills and over lowlands,<br/>
Over swamps and over snow-fields,<br/>
Over mountains clothed in heather,<br/>
That the eye may not behold him,<br/>
Nor the hero’s ear detect him.<br/>
Thereupon the mighty hunter<br/>
Angry grows, and much disheartened,<br/>
Starts again the moose to capture,<br/>
Gliding off behind the courser.<br/>
With his might he plunges forward;<br/>
At the instep breaks his snow-shoe,<br/>
Breaks the runners into fragments,<br/>
On the mountings breaks his javelins,<br/>
In the centre breaks his snow-staff,<br/>
And the moose bounds on before him,<br/>
Through the Hisi-woods and snow-fields,<br/>
Out of reach of Lemminkainen.<br/>
Then the reckless Kaukomieli<br/>
Looked with bended head, ill-humored,<br/>
One by one upon the fragments,<br/>
Speaking words of ancient wisdom:<br/>
“Northland hunters, never, never,<br/>
Go defiant to thy forests,<br/>
In the Hisi vales and mountains,<br/>
There to hunt the moose of Juutas,<br/>
Like this senseless, reckless hero;<br/>
I have wrecked my magic snow-shoes,<br/>
Ruined too my useful snow-staff,<br/>
And my javelins I have broken,<br/>
While the wild-moose runs in safety<br/>
Through the Hisi fields and forests.”</p>
