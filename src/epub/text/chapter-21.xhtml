			<p>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient dame of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While at work within her dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the whips crack on the fenlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard the rattle of the sledges;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the northward turned her glances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned her vision to the sunlight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And her thoughts ran on as follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who are these in bright apparel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the banks of Pohya-waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are they friends or hostile armies?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the hostess of the Northland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked again and well considered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew much nearer to examine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found they were not hostile armies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found that they were friends and suitors.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the midst was Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Son-in-law to ancient Louhi.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the hostess of Pohyola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw the son-in-law approaching</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She addressed the words that follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I had thought the winds were raging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the piles of wood were falling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought the pebbles in commotion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or perchance the ocean roaring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I hastened nearer, nearer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew still nearer and examined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found the winds were not in battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found the piles of wood unshaken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found the ocean was not roaring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the pebbles in commotion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found my son-in-law was coming</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his heroes and attendants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heroes counted by the hundreds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Should you ask of me the question,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How I recognized the bridegroom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mid the hosts of men and heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should answer, I should tell you:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘As the hazel-bush in copses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the oak-tree in the forest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the Moon among the planets;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drives the groom a coal-black courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Running like the famished black-dog,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying like the hungry raven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Graceful as the lark at morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden cuckoos, six in number,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Twitter on the birchen cross-bow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There are seven bluebirds singing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the racer’s hame and collar.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Noises hear they in the court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the highway hear the sledges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the court comes Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his body-guard of heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the midst the chosen suitor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not too far in front of others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not too far behind his fellows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hie ye hither, men and heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haste, ye watchers, to the stables,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There unhitch the suitor’s stallion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lower well the racer’s breast-plate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There undo the straps and buckles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loosen well the shafts and traces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And conduct the suitor hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give my son-in-law good welcome!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen turned his racer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into Louhi’s yard and stables,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And descended from his snow-sledge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come, thou servant of my bidding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Best of all my trusted servants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take at once the bridegroom’s courser</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the shafts adorned with silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the curving arch of willow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lift the harness trimmed in copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tie the white-face to the manger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Treat the suitor’s steed with kindness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead him carefully to shelter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By his soft and shining bridle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By his halter tipped with silver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let him roll among the sand-hills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the bottoms soft and even,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the borders of the snow-banks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the fields of milky color.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lead the hero’s steed to water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead him to the Pohya-fountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the living streams are flowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet as milk of human kindness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the roots of silvery birches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Underneath the shade of aspens.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Feed the courser of the suitor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the sweetest corn and barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the summer-wheat and clover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the caldron steeped in sweetness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed him at the golden manger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the boxes lined with copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At my manger richly furnished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the warmest of the stables;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tie him with a silk-like halter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the golden rings and staples,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hooks of purest silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set in beams of birch and oak-wood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed him on the hay the sweetest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feed him on the corn nutritious,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give the best my barns can furnish.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Curry well the suitor’s courser</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the curry-comb of fish-bone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brush his hair with silken brushes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put his mane and tail in order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cover well with flannel blankets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blankets wrought in gold and silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Buckles forged from shining copper.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come, ye small lads of the village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead the suitor to my chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With your auburn locks uncovered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From your hands remove your mittens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See if ye can lead the hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the door without his stooping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifting not the upper cross-bar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lowering not the oaken threshold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moving not the birchen casings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great the hero who must enter.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ilmarinen is too stately,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot enter through the portals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the son-in-law and bridegroom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the portals have been heightened;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taller by a head the suitor</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than the door-ways of the mansion.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the servants of Pohyola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tore away the upper cross-bar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his cap might not be lifted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the oaken threshold lower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the hero might not stumble;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the birch-wood portals wider,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Opened full the door of welcome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Easy entrance for the suitor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks the hostess of the Northland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the bridegroom freely passes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the doorway of her dwelling:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thanks are due to thee, O Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That my son-in-law has entered!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me now my halls examine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the bridal chambers ready,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finest linen on my tables,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Softest furs upon my benches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Birchen flooring scrubbed to whiteness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my rooms in perfect order.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the hostess of Pohyola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Visited her spacious dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not recognize her chambers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every room had been remodeled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Changed by force of mighty magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the halls were newly burnished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hedge-hog bones were used for ceilings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bones of reindeer for foundations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bones of wolverine for door-sills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the cross-bars bones of roebuck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Apple-wood were all the rafters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alder-wood, the window-casings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scales of trout adorned the windows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the fires were set in flowers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the seats were made of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the floors of copper-tiling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gold-adorned were all the tables,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the floor were silken mattings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every fire-place set in copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every hearth-stone cut from marble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On each shelf were colored sea-shells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kalew’s tree was their protection.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the court-room came the hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chosen suitor from Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of Ilmarinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Send, O Ukko, health and pleasure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To this ancient home and dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To this mansion richly fashioned!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let thy coming be auspicious</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To these halls of thee unworthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the home of thine affianced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To this dwelling lowly fashioned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mid the lindens and the aspens.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come, ye maidens that should serve me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, ye fellows from the village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me fire upon the birch-bark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Light the fagots of the fir-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I may behold the bridegroom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chosen suitor of my daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairy Maiden of the Rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See the color of his eyeballs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether they are blue or sable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See if they are warm and faithful.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick the young lads from the village</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought the fire upon the birch-bark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought it on the tips of pine-wood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the fire and smoke commingled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roll and roar about the hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blackening the suitor’s visage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the hostess speaks as follows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Bring the fire upon a taper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the waxen tapers bring it!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the maidens did as bidden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly brought the lighted tapers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the suitor’s eyeballs glisten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made his cheeks look fresh and ruddy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made his eyes of sable color</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sparkle like the foam of waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the reed-grass on the margin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Colored as the ocean jewels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Iridescent as the rainbow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come, ye fellows of the hamlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead my son-in-law and hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the highest seat at table,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the seat of greatest honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his back upon the blue-wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looking on my bounteous tables,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Facing all the guests of Northland.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the hostess of Pohyola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Served her guests in great abundance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Richest drinks and rarest viands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First of all she, served the bridegroom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his platters, honeyed biscuit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sweetest river salmon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seasoned butter, roasted bacon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the dainties of Pohyola.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the helpers served the others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled the plates of all invited</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the varied food of Northland.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come, ye maidens from the village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither bring the beer in pitchers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the urns with double handles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the many guests in-gathered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere all others, serve the bridegroom.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon the merry maidens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought the beer in silver pitchers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the copper-banded vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the wedding-guests assembled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the beer, fermenting, sparkled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the beard of Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the beards of many heroes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the guests had all partaken</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the wondrous beer of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the beer in merry accents</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the tongues of the magicians,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the tongue of many a hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the tongue of Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Famed to be the sweetest singer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Northland bards and minstrels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words of the enchanter:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou beer of honeyed flavor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us not imbibe in silence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let some hero sing thy praises,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing thy worth in golden measures;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the hostess start the singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the bridegroom sound thy virtues!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have our songs thus quickly vanished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have our joyful tongues grown silent?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evil then has been the brewing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the beer must be unworthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That it does not cheer the singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not move the merry minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the golden guests are joyless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the cuckoo is not singing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never will these benches echo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the bench-guests chant thy virtues;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the floor resound thy praises</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the floor-guests sing in concord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the windows join the chorus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the window-guests have spoken;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the tables will keep silence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the heroes toast thy virtues;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Little singing from the chimney</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the chimney-guests have chanted.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the floor a child was sitting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the little boy made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I am small and young in singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have perchance but little wisdom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be that as it may, my seniors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since the elder minstrels sing not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the heroes chant their legends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the hostess lead the singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will sing my simple stories,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing my little store of knowledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the pleasure of the evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the joy of the invited.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the fire reclined an old man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the gray-beard thus made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not the time for children’s singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Children’s wisdom is too ready,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Children’s songs are filled with trifles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled with shrewd and vain deceptions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maiden-songs are full of follies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave the songs and incantations</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the ancient wizard-singers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave the tales of times primeval</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the minstrel of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hero of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the, ancient Wainamoinen.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereupon Osmoinen answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Are there not some sweeter singers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this honored congregation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will clasp their hands together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the ancient songs unbroken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus begin the incantations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make these ancient halls re-echo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the pleasure of the evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the joy of the in-gathered?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the hearth-stone spake, the gray-beard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not a singer of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a minstrel, nor magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That was better skilled in chanting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Legends of the days departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than was I when I was singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my years of vain ambition;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I chanted tales of heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the blue back of the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the ballads of my people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the vales and on the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the verdant fields and forests;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet my voice and skilled my singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my songs were highly lauded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rippled like the quiet rivers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Easy-flowing like the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Easy-gliding as the snow-shoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the ship upon the ocean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Woe is me, my days are ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would not recognize my singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All its sweetness gone to others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flows no more like rippling waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes no more the hills re-echo!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now my songs are full of discord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the rake upon the stubble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the sledge upon the gravel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the boat upon the sea-shore!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the ancient Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in magic measures:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Since no other bard appeareth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That will clasp my hand in singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will sing some simple legends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing my, garnered store of wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make these magic halls re-echo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my tales of ancient story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since a bard I was created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Born an orator and singer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not ask the ways of others,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Follow not the paths of strangers.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen, famous minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Song’s eternal, wise supporter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then began the songs of pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made the halls resound with joyance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled the rooms with wondrous singing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the ancient bard-magician</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the oldest wisdom-sayings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not fail in voice nor legends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the wisest thoughts remembered.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the ancient Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the joy of all assembled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the pleasure of the evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the merriment of maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the happiness of heroes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the guests were stilled in wonder</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the magic of his singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the songs of the magician.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake again wise Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When his wonder-tales had ended:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“l have little worth or power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Am a bard of little value,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Little consequence my singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine abilities as nothing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If but Ukko, my Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should intone his wisdom-sayings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the source of good and evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the origin of matter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the legends of omniscience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing his songs in full perfection.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God could sing the floods to honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the sands to ruddy berries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing the pebbles into barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing to beer the running waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing to salt the rocks of ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into corn-fields sing the forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into gold the forest-fruitage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing to bread the hills and mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing to eggs the rounded sandstones;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He could touch the springs of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He could turn the keys of nature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And produce within thy pastures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurdles filled with sheep and reindeer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stables filled with fleet-foot stallions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kine in every field and fallow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing a fur-robe for the bridegroom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the bride a coat of ermine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the hostess, shoes of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the hero, mail of copper.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Grant O Ukko, my Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God of love, and truth, and justice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant thy blessing on our feasting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bless this company assembled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the good of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the happiness of Northland!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May this bread and beer bring joyance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May they come in rich abundance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May they carry full contentment</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the people of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cabin and the mansion;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May the hours we spend in singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the morning, in the evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill our hearts with joy and gladness!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear us in our supplications,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant to us thy needed blessings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send enjoyment, health, and comfort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the people here assembled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the host and to the hostess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bride and to the bridegroom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the sons upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the daughters at their weavings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hunters on the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the shepherds in the fenlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That our lives may end in honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That we may recall with pleasure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ilmarinen’s magic marriage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Maiden of the Rainbow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snow-white virgin of the Northland.”</span>
