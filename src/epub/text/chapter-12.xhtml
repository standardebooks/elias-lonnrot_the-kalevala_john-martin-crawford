			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen, artful husband,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reckless hero, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Constantly beside his young wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Passed his life in sweet contentment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the years rolled swiftly onward;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ahti thought not of the battles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor Kyllikki of the dances.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Once upon a time it happened</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the hero, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went upon the lake a-fishing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not home at early evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the cruel night descended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the village went Kyllikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dance of merry maidens.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who will tell the evil story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will bear the information</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the husband, Lemminkainen?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ahti’s sister tells the story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sister’s name, Ainikki.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon she spreads the cruel tidings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway gives the information,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Kyllikki’s perjured honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words Ainikki utters:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ahti, my beloved brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the village went Kyllikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the hall of many strangers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the plays and village dances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the young men and the maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the maids of braided tresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the halls of joy and pleasure.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen, much dejected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broken-hearted, flushed with anger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in measured accents:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mother dear, my gray-haired mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou straightway wash my linen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the blood of poison-serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the black blood of the adder?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must hasten to the combat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the camp-fires of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the battle-fields of Lapland;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the village went Kyllikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the play of merry maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the games and village dances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the maids of braided tresses.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway speaks the wife, Kyllikki:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My beloved husband, Ahti,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not go to war, I pray thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the evening I lay sleeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slumbering I saw in dream-land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire upshooting from the chimney,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flames arising, mounting skyward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the windows of this dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the summits of these rafters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Piercing through our upper chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roaring like the fall of waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaping from the floor and ceiling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Darting from the halls and doorways.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the doubting Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes this answer to Kyllikki:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I discredit dreams of women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have no faith in vows of maidens!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faithful mother of my being,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither bring my mail of copper;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strong desire is stirring in me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the cup of deadly combat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the mead of martial conquest.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the pleading mother’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lemminkainen, son beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not go to war I pray thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have foaming beer abundant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In our vessels beer of barley,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held in casks by oaken spigots;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drink this beer of peace and pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let us drink of it together.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I shall taste no more the viands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the home of false Kyllikki;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rather would I drink the water</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the painted tips of birch-oars;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweeter far to me the water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than the beverage of dishonor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At my mother’s home and fireside!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hither bring my martial doublet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me now the sword of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring my father’s sword of honor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must go to upper Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the battle-fields of Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to win me gold and silver.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the anxious mother’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My beloved Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have gold in great abundance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gold and silver in the store-room;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Recently upon the uplands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the early hours of morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toiled the workmen in the corn-fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plowed the meadows filled with serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the plowshare raised the cover</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From a chest of gold and silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Countless was the gold uncovered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hid beneath the grassy meadow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the treasure I have brought thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take the countless gold in welcome.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do not wish thy household silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the wars I’ll earn my silver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gold and silver from the combat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are to me of greater value</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than the wealth thou hast discovered.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me now my heavy armor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me too my spear and broadsword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Northland I must hasten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bloody wars of Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thither does my pride impel me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thitherward my heart is turning.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I have heard a tale of Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some believe the wondrous story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That a maid in Pimentola</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lives that does not care for suitors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not care for bearded heroes.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the aged mother’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Warlike Ahti, son beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy home thou hast Kyllikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest wife of all the islands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strange to see two wives abiding</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the home of but one husband.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hero, Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To the village runs Kyllikki;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let her run to village dances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let her sleep in other dwellings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the village youth find pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the maids of braided tresses.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seeks the mother to detain him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the anxious mother answers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do not go, my son beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ignorant of Pohya-witchcraft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the distant homes of Northland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till thou hast the art of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till thou hast some little wisdom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not go to fields of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the fires of Northland’s children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the slaughter-fields of Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till of magic thou art master.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the Lapland maids will charm thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turyalanders will bewitch thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing thy visage into charcoal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Head and shoulders to the furnace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into ashes sing thy fore-arm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into fire direct thy footsteps.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the warlike Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wizards often have bewitched me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the fascinating serpents;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lapland wizards, three in number,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On an eve in time of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting on a rock at twilight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a garment to protect them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once bewitched me with their magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This much they have taken from me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the sum of all my losses:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the hatchet gains from flint-stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the auger bores from granite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the heel chips from the iceberg,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what death purloins from tomb-stones.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Horribly the wizards threatened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tried to sink me with their magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the water of the marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mud and treacherous quicksand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To my chin in mire and water;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I too was born a hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Born a hero and magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not troubled by their magic.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Straightway I began my singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the archers with their arrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the spearmen with their weapons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the swordsmen with their poniards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the singers with their singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The enchanters with their magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the rapids of the rivers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the highest fall of waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the all-devouring whirlpool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the deepest depths of ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the wizards still are sleeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleeping till the grass shoots upward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the beards and wrinkled faces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the locks of the enchanters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As they sleep beneath the billows.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still entreats the anxious mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still beseeches Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trying to restrain the hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While Kyllikki begs forgiveness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the language of the mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do not go, my son beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the villages of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor to Lapland’s frigid borders;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dire misfortune will befall thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Star of evil settle o’er thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s end, destruction.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Couldst thou speak in tongues a hundred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I could not believe thee able,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the magic of thy singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To enchant the sons of Lapland</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the bottom of the ocean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost not know the Tury-language,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Canst but speak the tongue of Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Canst not win by witless magic.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen, reckless hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Also known as Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood beside his mother, combing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out his sable locks and musing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brushing down his beard, debating,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steadfast still in his decision,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly hurls his brush in anger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurls it to the wall opposing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives his mother final answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words that Ahti uses:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Dire misfortune will befall me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some sad fate will overtake me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evil come to Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the blood flows from that hair-brush,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When blood oozes from those bristles.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus the warlike Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goes to never-pleasant Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heeding not his mother’s warning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heeding not her prohibition.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus the hero, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick equips himself for warfare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his head a copper helmet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his shoulders caps of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his body iron armor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steel, the belt around his body;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he girds himself for battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ahti thus soliloquizing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Strong the hero in his armor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strong indeed in copper helmet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Powerful in mail of iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stronger far than any hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the dismal shores of Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Need not fear their wise enchanters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Need not fear their strongest foemen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Need not fear a war with wizards.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Grasped he then the sword of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Firmly grasped the heavy broadsword</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Tuoni had been grinding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the gods had brightly burnished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrust it in the leathern scabbard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tied the scabbard to his armor.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How do heroes guard from danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where protect themselves from evil?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heroes guard their homes and firesides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guard their doors, and roofs, and windows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guard the posts that hold the torch-lights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guard the highways to the court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guard the ends of all the gate-ways.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heroes guard themselves from women,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carefully from merry maidens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If in this their strength be wanting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Easy fall the heroes, victims</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the snares of the enchanters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Furthermore are heroes watchful</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the tribes of warlike giants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the highway doubly branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the borders of the blue-rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the marshes filled with evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the mighty fall of waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the circling of the whirlpool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the fiery springs and rapids.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the stout-heart, Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Rise ye heroes of the broadsword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye, the earth’s eternal heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the deeps, ye sickle-bearers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the brooks, ye crossbow-shooters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, thou forest, with thine archers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, ye thickets, with your armies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mountain spirits, with your powers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, fell Hisi, with thy horrors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Water-mother, with thy dangers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, Wellamo, with thy mermaids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, ye maidens from the valleys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, ye nymphs from winding rivers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be protection to this hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be his day-and-night companions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Body-guard to Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to blunt the spears of wizards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to dull their pointed arrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the spears of the enchanters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the arrows of the archers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the weapons of the foemen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not harm this bearded hero.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Should this force be insufficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can call on other powers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I can call the gods above me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call the great god of the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him who gives the clouds their courses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him who rules through boundless ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who directs the march of storm-winds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ukko, thou O God above me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou the father of creation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou that speakest through the thunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou whose weapon is the lightning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou whose voice is borne by ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant me now thy mighty fire-sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give me here thy burning arrows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lightning arrows for my quiver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus protect me from all danger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guard me from the wiles of witches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guide my feet from every evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Help me conquer the enchanters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Help me drive them from the Northland;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those that stand in front of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those that fill the ranks behind me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those around me, those above me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those beneath me, help me banish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their knives, and swords, and crossbows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their spears of keenest temper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With their tongues of evil magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Help me drive these Lapland wizards</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the deepest depths of ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to wrestle with Wellamo.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the reckless Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whistled loudly for his stallion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called the racer from the hurdles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called his brown steed from the pasture,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Threw the harness on the courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hitched the fleet-foot to the snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaped upon the highest cross-bench,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cracked his whip above the racer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the steed flies onward swiftly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bounds the sleigh upon its journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the golden plain re-echoes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travels one day, then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travels all the next day northward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the third day evening brings him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a sorry Northland village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the dismal shores of Lapland.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here the hero, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drove along the lowest highway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the streets along the border,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a court-yard in the hamlet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked one standing in the doorway:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is there one within this dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can loose my stallion’s breastplate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can lift his heavy collar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That these shafts can rightly lower?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the floor a babe was playing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the young child gave this answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There is no one in this dwelling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can loose thy stallion’s breastplate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can lift his heavy collar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the shafts can rightly lower.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen, not discouraged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whips his racer to a gallop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rushes forward through the village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the middle of the highways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the court-yard in the centre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asks one standing in the threshold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaning on the penthouse door-posts:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is there any one here dwelling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can slip my stallion’s bridle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can loose his leathern breast-straps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can tend my royal racer?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the fireplace spake a wizard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From her bench the witch made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou canst find one in this dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can slip thy courser’s bridle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can loose his heavy breastplate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can tend thy royal racer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There are here a thousand heroes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can make thee hasten homeward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can give thee fleet-foot stallions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can chase thee to thy country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reckless rascal and magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy home and fellow minstrels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the uplands of thy father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cabins of thy mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the work-bench of thy brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dairy of thy sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the evening star has risen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the sun retires to slumber.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen, little fearing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives this answer to the wizard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I should slay thee for thy pertness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy clatter might be silenced.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he whipped his fiery charger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the steed flew onward swiftly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the upper of the highways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the court-yard on the summit.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the reckless Lemminkainen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had approached the upper court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Uttered he the words that follow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou Hisi, stuff this watch-dog,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lempo, stuff his throat and nostrils,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close the mouth of this wild barker,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bridle well the vicious canine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the watcher may be silent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the hero passes by him.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he stepped within the court-room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his whip he struck the flooring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the floor arose a vapor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the fog appeared a pigmy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who unhitched the royal racer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his back removed the harness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave the weary steed attention.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carefully advanced and listened.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one saw the strange magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one heard his cautious footsteps;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard he songs within the dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the moss-stuffed chinks heard voices,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the walls he heard them singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the doors the peals of laughter.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then he spied within the court-rooms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lurking slyly in the hall-ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found the court-rooms filled with singers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the walls were players seated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the doors the wise men hovered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skilful ones upon the benches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near the fires the wicked wizards;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All were singing songs of Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing songs of evil Hisi.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the minstrel, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Changes both his form and stature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Passes through the inner doorways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enters he the spacious court-hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these words the hero utters:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fine the singing quickly ending,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good the song that quickly ceases;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better far to keep thy wisdom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than to sing it on the house-tops.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Comes the hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fleetly rushing through the doorway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the centre of the court-room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And addresses thus the stranger:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Formerly a dog lay watching,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was a cur of iron-color,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fond of flesh, a bone-devourer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loved to lick the blood of strangers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who then art thou of the heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who of all the host of heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou art within my court-rooms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thou comest to my dwelling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not seen without my portals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not scented by my watch-dogs?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the reckless Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do not think that I come hither</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Having neither wit nor wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Having neither art nor power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanting in ancestral knowledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lacking prudence of the fathers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thy watch-dogs may devour me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My devoted mother washed me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a frail and tender baby,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three times in the nights of summer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nine times in the nights of autumn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That upon my journeys northward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I might sing the ancient wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus protect myself from danger;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When at home I sing as wisely</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the minstrels of thy hamlet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the singer, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ancient hero, Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick began his incantations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway sang the songs of witchcraft;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his fur-robe darts the lightning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flames outshooting from his eyeballs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the magic of his singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his wonderful enchantment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the very best of singers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the very worst of minstrels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled their mouths with dust and ashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Piled the rocks upon their shoulders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stilled the best of Lapland witches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stilled the sorcerers and wizards.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he banished all their heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Banished all their proudest minstrels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This one hither, that one thither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the lowlands poor in verdure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the unproductive uplands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the oceans wanting whiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the waterfalls of Rutya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the whirlpool hot and flaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the waters decked with sea-foam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into fires and boiling waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into everlasting torment.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the foemen with their broadswords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the heroes with their weapons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the eldest, sang the youngest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang the middle-aged, enchanted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only one he left his senses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He a poor, defenseless shepherd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old and sightless, halt and wretched,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the old man’s name was Nasshut.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the miserable shepherd:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou hast old and young enchanted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast banished all our heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why hast spared this wretched shepherd?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is Lemminkainen’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Therefore have I not bewitched thee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou art old, and blind, and wretched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feeble-minded thou, and harmless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loathsome now without my magic.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou didst, in thy better lifetime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When a shepherd filled with malice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ruin all thy mother’s berries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make thy sister, too unworthy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ruin all thy brother’s cattle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive to death thy father’s stallions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the marshes, o’er the meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the lowlands, o’er the mountains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heeding not thy mother’s counsel.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the wretched Nasshut,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Angry grew and swore for vengeance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway limping through the doorway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hobbled on beyond the court-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the meadow-lands and pastures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the river of the death-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the holy stream and whirlpool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the kingdom of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the islands of Manala;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waited there for Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Listened long for Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thinking he must pass this river</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his journey to his country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the highway to the islands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the upper shores of Pohya,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the dreary Sariola.</span>
