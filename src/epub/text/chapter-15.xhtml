			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s aged mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anxious roams about the islands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anxious wonders in her chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the fate of Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why her son so long has tarried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thinks that something ill has happened</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To her hero in Pohyola.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sad, indeed, the mother’s anguish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As in vain she waits his coming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As in vain she asks the question,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where her daring son is roaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether to the fir-tree mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether to the distant heath-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or upon the broad-sea’s ridges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the floods and rolling waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the war’s contending armies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the heat and din of battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steeped in blood of valiant heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evidence of fatal warfare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Daily does the wife Kyllikki</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look about her vacant chamber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the home of Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the court of Kaukomieli;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looks at evening, looks at morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looks, perchance, upon his hair-brush,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees alas! the blood-drops oozing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oozing from the golden bristles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the blood-drops, scarlet-colored.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the beauteous wife, Kyllikki,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in deeps of anguish:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Dead or wounded is my husband,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or at best is filled with trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lost perhaps in Northland forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In some glen unknown to heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since alas! the blood is flowing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the brush of Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red drops oozing from the bristles.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the anxious mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looks upon the bleeding hair-brush</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And begins this wail of anguish:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Woe is me, my life hard-fated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woe is me, all joy departed!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For alas! my son and hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Valiant hero of the islands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Son of trouble and misfortune!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some sad fate has overtaken</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My ill-fated Lemminkainen!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blood is flowing from his hair-brush,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oozing from its golden bristles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the drops are scarlet-colored.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quick her garment’s hem she clutches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her arm she throws her long-robes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fleetly flies upon her journey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her might she hastens northward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mountains tremble from her footsteps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Valleys rise and heights are lowered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Highlands soon become as lowlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the hills and valleys levelled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soon she gains the Northland village,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly asks about her hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words the mother utters:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou hostess of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where hast thou my Lemminkainen?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me of my son and hero!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Louhi, hostess of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives this answer to the mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nothing know I of thy hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the hero of the islands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where thy son may be I know not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot lend the information;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once I gave thy son a courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hitched the racer to his snow-sledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the last of Lemminkainen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May perchance be drowned in Wuhne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frozen in the icy ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fallen prey to wolves in hunger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a bear’s den may have perished.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou art only speaking falsehoods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Northland wolves cannot devour us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the bears kill Kaukomieli;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He can slay the wolves of Pohya</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the fingers of his left hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bears of Northland he would silence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the magic of his singing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hostess of Pohyola, tell me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither thou hast sent my hero;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I shall burst thy many garners,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall destroy the magic Sampo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou dost not tell me truly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where to find my Lemminkainen.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have well thy hero treated,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well my court has entertained him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave him of my rarest viands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fed him at my well-filled tables,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Placed him in a boat of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to float adown the current,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the last of Lemminkainen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot tell where he has wandered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether in the foam of waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether in the boiling torrent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether in the drowning whirlpool.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou again art speaking falsely;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me now the truth I pray thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make an end of thy deception,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where is now my Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whither hast thou sent my hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young and daring son of Kalew?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If a third time thou deceivest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will send thee plagues, unnumbered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will send thee fell destruction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Certain death will overtake thee.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the hostess of Pohyola:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This the third time that I answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the truth that I shall tell thee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have sent the Kalew-hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Hisi-fields and forests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to hunt the moose of Lempo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent him then to catch the fire-horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Catch the fire-expiring stallion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the distant plains of Juutas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the realm of cruel Hisi.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I sent him to the Death-stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the kingdom of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his bow and but one arrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to shoot the swan as dowry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For my best and fairest daughter;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have not heard about thy hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since he left for Tuonela;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May in misery have fallen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May have perished in Manala;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has not come to ask my daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has not come to woo the maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since he left to hunt the death-swan.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the mother seeks her lost one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her son she weeps and trembles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the wolf she bounds through fenlands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the bear, through forest thickets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the wild-boar, through the marshes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the hare, along the sea-coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the sea-point, like the hedgehog,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the wild-duck swims the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Casts the rubbish from her pathway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tramples down opposing brushwood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stops at nothing in her journey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeks a long time for her hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeks, and seeks, and does not find him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now she asks the trees the question,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the forest gives this answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“We have care enough already,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot think about thy matters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cruel fates have we to battle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pitiful our own misfortunes!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We are felled and chopped in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cut in blocks for hero-fancy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We are burned to death as fuel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No one cares how much we suffer.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now again the mother wanders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeks again her long-lost hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeks, and seeks, and does not find him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Paths arise and come to meet her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she questions thus the pathways:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Paths of hope that God has fashioned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have ye seen my Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has my son and golden hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travelled through thy many kingdoms?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sad, the many pathways answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“We ourselves have cares sufficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot watch thy son and hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wretched are the lives of pathways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep indeed our own misfortunes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We are trodden by the red-deer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the wolves, and bears, and roebucks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Driven o’er by heavy cart-wheels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the feet of dogs are trodden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trodden under foot of heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Footpaths for contending armies.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seeks again the frantic mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeks her long-lost son and hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeks, and seeks, and does not find him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds the Moon within her orbit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asks the Moon in pleading measures:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Golden Moon, whom God has stationed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the heavens, the Sun’s companion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast thou seen my Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast thou seen my silver apple,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anywhere in thy dominions?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the golden Moon makes answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have trouble all-sufficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannot watch thy daring hero;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long the journey I must travel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sad the fate to me befallen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pitiful mine own misfortunes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All alone the nights to wander,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shine alone without a respite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the winter ever watching,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the summer sink and perish.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still the mother seeks, and wanders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeks, and does not find her hero;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees the Sun in the horizon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the mother thus entreats him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Silver Sun, whom God has fashioned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou that giveth warmth and comfort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast thou lately seen my hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast thou seen my Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandering in thy dominions?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the Sun in kindness answers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Surely has thy hero perished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ingratitude a victim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen died and vanished</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Tuoni’s fatal river,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the waters of Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sacred stream and whirlpool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the cataract and rapids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sank within the drowning current</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the realm of Tuonela,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Manala’s lower regions.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wailing in the deeps of anguish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mourns the fate of Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens to the Northland smithy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the forge of Ilmarinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the words the mother utters:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ilmarinen, metal-artist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou that long ago wert forging,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forging earth a concave cover,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yesterday wert forging wonders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge thou now, immortal blacksmith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge a rake with shaft of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forge the teeth of strongest metal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Teeth in length a hundred fathoms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And five hundred long the handle.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ilmarinen does as bidden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes the rake in full perfection.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s anxious mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the magic rake and hastens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the river of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Praying to the Sun as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou, O Sun, by God created,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou that shinest on thy Maker,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shine for me in heat of magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give me warmth, and strength, and courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shine a third time full of power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lull to sleep the wicked people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still the people of Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quiet all Tuoni’s empire.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the sun of Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dearest child of the Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying through the groves of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sitting on a curving birch-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shines a little while in ardor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shines again in greater fervor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shines a third time full of power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lulls to sleep the wicked people</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Manala home and kingdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still the heroes with their broadswords,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes the lancers halt and totter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stills the stoutest of the spearmen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quiets Tuoni’s ghastly empire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the Sun retires in magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hovers here and there a moment</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over Tuoni’s hapless sleepers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens upward to his station,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his Jumala home and kingdom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s faithful mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the rake of magic metals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rakes the Tuoni river bottoms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rakes the cataract and whirlpool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rakes the swift and boiling current</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the sacred stream of death-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Manala home and kingdom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Searching for her long-lost hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rakes a long time, finding nothing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now she wades the river deeper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To her belt in mud and water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeper, deeper, rakes the death-stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rakes the river’s deepest caverns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raking up and down the current,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till at last she finds his tunic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heavy-hearted, finds his jacket;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rakes again and rakes unceasing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds the hero’s shoes and stockings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sorely troubled, finds these relics;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now she wades the river deeper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rakes the Manala shoals and shallows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rakes the deeps at every angle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As she draws the rake the third time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the Tuoni shores and waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the rake she finds the body</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her long-lost Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the metal teeth entangled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the rake with copper handle.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus the reckless Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the son of Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was recovered from the bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the Manala lake and river.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There were wanting many fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half the head, a hand, a fore-arm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many other smaller portions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Life, above all else, was missing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the mother, well reflecting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words in bitter weeping:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“From these fragments, with my magic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will bring to life my hero.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hearing this, the raven answered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these measures to the mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There is not in these a hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou canst not revive these fragments;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eels have fed upon his body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On his eyes have fed the whiting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast the dead upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the streams of Tuonela,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let him there become a walrus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or a seal, or whale, or porpoise.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother does not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast the dead upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the streams of Tuonela;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She again with hope and courage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rakes the river lengthwise, crosswise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the Manala pools and caverns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rakes up half the head, a fore-arm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds a hand and half the back-bone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many other smaller portions;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shapes her son from all the fragments,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shapes anew her Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flesh to flesh with skill she places,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives the bones their proper stations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Binds one member to the other,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joins the ends of severed vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Counts the threads of all the venules,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knits the parts in apposition;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then this prayer the mother offers:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Suonetar, thou slender virgin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goddess of the veins of heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skilful spinner of the vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thy slender, silver spindle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thy spinning-wheel of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set in frame of molten silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come thou hither, thou art needed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring the instruments for mending,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Firmly knit the veins together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the end join well the venules,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the wounds that still are open,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the members that are injured.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Should this aid be inefficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is living in the ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a boat enriched with silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a copper boat, a maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That can bring to thee assistance.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, O maiden, from the ether,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Virgin from the belt of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Row throughout these veins, O maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Row through all these lifeless members,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the channels of the long-bones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Row through every form of tissue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set the vessels in their places,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay the heart in right position,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the pulses beat together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Join the smallest of the veinlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And unite with skill the sinews.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take thou now a slender needle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silken thread within its eyelet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ply the silver needle gently,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sew with care the wounds together.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Should this aid be inefficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou, O God, that knowest all things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come and give us thine assistance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harness thou thy fleetest racer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call to aid thy strongest courser,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thy scarlet sledge come swiftly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive through all the bones and channels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive throughout these lifeless tissues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drive thy courser through each vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bind the flesh and bones securely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the joints put finest silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Purest gold in all the fissures.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Where the skin is broken open,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the veins are torn asunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mend these injuries with magic;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the blood has left the body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There make new blood flow abundant;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the bones are rudely broken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set the parts in full perfection;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the flesh is bruised and loosened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touch the wounds with magic balsam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not leave a part imperfect;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bone, and vein, and nerve, and sinew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heart, and brain, and gland, and vessel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heal as Thou alone canst heal them.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These the means the mother uses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus she joins the lifeless members,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus she heals the death-like tissues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus restores her son and hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his former life and likeness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All his veins are knit together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All their ends are firmly fastened,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the parts in apposition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Life returns, but speech is wanting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deaf and dumb, and blind, and senseless.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the mother speaks as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Where may I procure the balsam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the drops of magic honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To anoint my son and hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to heal my Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That again his month may open,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May again begin his singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak again in words of wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing again his incantations?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Tiny bee, thou honey-birdling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lord of all the forest flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly away and gather honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring to me the forest-sweetness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found in Metsola’s rich gardens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in Tapio’s fragrant meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the petals of the flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the blooming herbs and grasses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to heal my hero’s anguish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to heal his wounds of evil.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the honey-birdling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flies away on wings of swiftness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into Metsola’s rich gardens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into Tapio’s flowery meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathers sweetness from the meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the tongue distills the honey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the cups of seven flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the bloom of countless grasses;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick from Metsola returning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying, humming, darting onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his winglets honey-laden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the store of sweetest odors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the mother brings the balsam.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s anxious mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes the balm of magic virtues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And anoints the injured hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heals his wounds and stills his anguish;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the balm is inefficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her son is deaf and speechless.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then again outspeaks the mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Little bee, my honey-birdling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly away in one direction,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly across the seven oceans,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the eighth, a magic island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the honey is enchanted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the distant Turi-castles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the chambers of Palwoinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the honey is effective,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There, the wonder-working balsam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This may heal the wounded hero;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bring me of this magic ointment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I may anoint his eyelids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May restore his injured senses.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the honey-birdling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flew away o’er seven oceans,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the old enchanted island;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flies one day, and then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the verdure does not settle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Does not rest upon the flowers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flies a third day, fleetly onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till a third day evening brings him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the island in the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the meadows rich in honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the cataract and fire-flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the sacred stream and whirlpool.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There the honey was preparing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the magic balm distilling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the tiny earthen vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the burnished copper kettles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smaller than a maiden’s thimble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smaller than the tips of fingers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faithfully the busy insect</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathers the enchanted honey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the magic Turi-cuplets</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the chambers of Palwoinen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Time had gone but little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the bee came loudly humming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying fleetly, honey-laden;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his arms were seven vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seven, the vessels on each shoulder;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All were filled with honey-balsam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the balm of magic virtues.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s tireless mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick anoints her speechless hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the magic Turi-balsam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the balm of seven virtues;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nine the times that she anoints him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the honey of Palwoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the wonder-working balsam;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the balm is inefficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the hero still is speechless.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then again outspeaks the mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Honey-bee, thou ether birdling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly a third time on thy journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly away to high Jumala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly thou to the seventh heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Honey there thou’lt find abundant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Balsam of the highest virtue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only used by the Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only made from the breath of Ukko.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God anoints his faithful children,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the honey of his wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they feel the pangs of sorrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When they meet the powers of evil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dip thy winglets in this honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steep thy plumage in His sweetness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither bring the all-sufficient</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Balsam of the great Creator;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This will still my hero’s anguish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This will heal his wounded tissues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This restore his long-lost vision,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the Northland hills re-echo</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the magic of his singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his wonderful enchantment.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the honey-bee made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I can never fly to heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the seventh of the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the distant home of Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With these wings of little virtue.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou canst surely fly to heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the seventh of the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the Moon, beneath the sunshine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the dim and distant starlight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the first day, flying upward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wilt near the Moon in heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fan the brow of Kootamoinen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the second thou canst rest thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the shoulders of Otava;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the third day, flying higher,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rest upon the seven starlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the heads of Hetewanè;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Short the journey that is left thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inconsiderable the distance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the home of mighty Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the dwellings of the blessed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereupon the bee arising,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the earth flies swiftly upward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens on with graceful motion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By his tiny wings borne heavenward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the paths of golden moonbeams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touches on the Moon’s bright borders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fans the brow of Kootamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rests upon Otava’s shoulders,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastens to the seven starlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the heads of Hetewanè,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flies to the Creator’s castle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the home of generous Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds the remedy preparing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds the balm of life distilling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the silver-tinted cauldrons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the purest golden kettles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On one side, heart-easing honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a second, balm of joyance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the third, life-giving balsam.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here the magic bee, selecting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Culls the sweet, life-giving balsam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gathers too, heart-easing honey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heavy-laden hastens homeward.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Time had traveled little distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the busy bee came humming</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the anxious mother waiting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his arms a hundred cuplets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a thousand other vessels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled with honey, filled with balsam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled with the balm of the Creator.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother quickly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Takes them on her tongue and tests them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Finds a balsam all-sufficient.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the mother spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have found the long-sought balsam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found the remedy of Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewith God anoints his people,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives them life, and faith, and wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heals their wounds and stills their anguish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes them strong against temptation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guards them from the evil-doers.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the mother well anointing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heals her son, the magic singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eyes, and ears, and tongue, and temples,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks, and cuts, and seams, anointing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touching well the life-blood centres,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words of magic import</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the sleeping Lemminkainen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wake, arise from out thy slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the worst of low conditions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From thy state of dire misfortune!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Slowly wakes the son and hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rises from the depths of slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks again in magic accents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These the first words of the singer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Long, indeed, have I been sleeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long unconscious of existence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But my sleep was full of sweetness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet the sleep in Tuonela,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knowing neither joy nor sorrow!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the answer of his mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Longer still thou wouldst have slumbered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were it not for me, thy mother;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me now, my son beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me that I well may hear thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who enticed thee to Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the river of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the fatal stream and whirlpool?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the hero, Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave this answer to his mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nasshut, the decrepit shepherd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the flocks of Sariola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blind, and halt, and poor, and wretched,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to whom I did a favor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the slumber-land of envy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nasshut sent me to Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the river of Tuoni;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent a serpent from the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent an adder from the death-stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the heart of Lemminkainen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not recognize the serpent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could not speak the serpent-language,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not know the sting of adders.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake again the ancient mother:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O thou son of little insight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Senseless hero, fool-magician,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou didst boast betimes thy magic</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To enchant the wise enchanters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the dismal shores of Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou didst think to banish heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the borders of Pohyola;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Didst not know the sting of serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Didst not know the reed of waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the magic word-protector!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Learn the origin of serpents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence the poison of the adder.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In the floods was born the serpent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the marrow of the gray-duck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the brain of ocean-swallows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suoyatar had made saliva,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast it on the waves of ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Currents drove it outward, onward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Softly shone the sun upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the winds ’twas gently cradled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gently nursed by winds and waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the waves was driven shoreward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Landed by the surging billows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the serpent, thing of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filling all the world with trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was created in the waters</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Born from Suoyatar, its maker.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the mother of the hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocked her son to rest and comfort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rocked him to his former being,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his former life and spirit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into greater magic powers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wiser, handsomer than ever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grew the hero of the islands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But his heart was full of trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his mother, ever watchful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked the cause of his dejection.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is Lemminkainen’s answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This the cause of all my sorrow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far away my heart is roaming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my thoughts forever wander</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Northland’s blooming virgins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the maids of braided tresses.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Northland’s ugly hostess, Louhi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will not give to me her daughter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest maiden of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till I kill the swan of Mana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my bow and but one arrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the river of Tuoni.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lemminkainen’s mother answers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the sacred stream and whirlpool.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let the swan swim on in safety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give the water-bird his freedom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the river of Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the whirlpool of Tuoni;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave the maiden in the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her charms and fading beauty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thy fond and faithful mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go at once to Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thy native fields and fallows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Praise thy fortune, all sufficient,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Praise, above all else, thy Maker.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ukko gave thee aid when needed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wert saved by thy Creator,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From thy long and hopeless slumber,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the waters of Tuoni,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the chambers of Manala.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I unaided could not save thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could not give the least assistance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God alone, omniscient Ukko,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First and last of the creators,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can revive the dead and dying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can protect his worthy people</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the waters of Manala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the fatal stream and whirlpool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the kingdom of Tuoni.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lemminkainen, filled with wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With his fond and faithful mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened straightway on his journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his distant home and kindred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the Wainola fields and meadows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the plains of Kalevala.</span>
			</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>
				<span>Here I leave my Kaukomieli,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave my hero Lemminkainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long I leave him from my singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn my song to other heroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Send it forth on other pathways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing some other golden legend.</span>
