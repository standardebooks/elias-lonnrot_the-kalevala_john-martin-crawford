			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>Far and wide the tidings travelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far away men heard the story</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the flight and death of Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sister dear of Youkahainen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest daughter of creation.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, brave and truthful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway fell to bitter weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept at morning, wept at evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleepless, wept the dreary night long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That his Aino had departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the maiden thus had vanished,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus had sunk upon the bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the blue-sea, deep and boundless.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Filled with grief, the ancient singer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wainamoinen of the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heavy-hearted, sorely weeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hastened to the restless waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This the suitor’s prayer and question:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tell, Untamo, tell me, dreamer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me, Indolence, thy visions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the water-gods may linger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where may rest Wellamo’s maidens?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Untamo thus made answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lazily he told his dreamings:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Over there, the mermaid-dwellings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yonder live Wellamo’s maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the headland robed in verdure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the forest-covered island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the deep, pellucid waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the purple-colored sea-shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yonder is the home of sea-maids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the maidens of Wellamo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Live there in their seaside chambers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rest within their water-caverns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the rocks of rainbow colors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the juttings of the sea-cliffs.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Straightway hastens Wainamoinen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a boat-house on the sea-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looks with care upon the fish-hooks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the lines he well considers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lines, and hooks, and poles, and fish-nets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Places in a boat of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then begins he swiftly rowing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the forest-covered island,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the point enrobed in verdure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the purple-colored headland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the sea-nymphs live and linger.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hardly does he reach the island</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere the minstrel starts to angle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far away he throws his fish-hook,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trolls it quickly through the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turning on a copper swivel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dangling from a silver fish-line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Golden is the hook he uses.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now he tries his silken fish-net,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Angles long, and angles longer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Angles one day, then a second,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the morning, in the evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Angles at the hour of noontide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many days and nights he angles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till at last, one sunny morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes a fish of magic powers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plays like salmon on his fish-line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lashing waves across the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till at length the fish exhausted</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls a victim to the angler,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Safely landed in the bottom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the hero’s boat of copper.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, proudly viewing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks these words in wonder guessing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This the fairest of all sea-fish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never have I seen its equal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smoother surely than the salmon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brighter-spotted than the trout is,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grayer than the pike of Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has less fins than any female,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the fins of any male fish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the stripes of sea-born maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the belt of any mermaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not the ears of any song-bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Somewhat like our Northland salmon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the blue-sea’s deepest caverns.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In his belt the ancient hero</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wore a knife insheathed with silver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From its case he drew the fish-knife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to carve the fish in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dress the nameless fish for roasting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make of it a dainty breakfast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make of it a meal at noon-day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make for him a toothsome supper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the later meal at evening.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Straightway as the fish he touches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touches with his knife of silver,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quick it leaps upon the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dives beneath the sea’s smooth surface,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the boat with copper bottom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the skiff of Wainamoinen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the waves at goodly distance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quickly from the sea it rises</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the sixth and seventh billows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifts its head above the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of reach of fishing-tackle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then addresses Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chiding thus the ancient hero:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wainamoinen, ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do not think that I came hither</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be fished for as a salmon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only to be chopped in pieces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dressed and eaten like a whiting</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make for thee a dainty breakfast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make for thee a meal at midday,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make for thee a toothsome supper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make the fourth meal of the Northland.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Wherefore didst thou then come hither,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If it be not for my dinner?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus the nameless fish made answer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hither have I come, O minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In thine arms to rest and linger,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thyself to love and cherish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At thy side a life-companion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thy wife to be forever;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deck thy couch with snowy linen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smooth thy head upon the pillow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweep thy rooms and make them cheery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keep thy dwelling-place in order,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Build a fire for thee when needed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bake for thee the honey-biscuit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fill thy cup with barley-water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do for thee whatever pleases.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I am not a scaly sea-fish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a trout of Northland rivers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a whiting from the waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a salmon of the North-seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, a young and merry maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Friend and sister of the fishes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Youkahainen’s youngest sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, the one that thou dost fish for,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am Aino whom thou lovest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Once thou wert the wise-tongued hero,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now the foolish Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scant of insight, scant of judgment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Didst not know enough to keep me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cruel-hearted, bloody-handed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tried to kill me with thy fish-knife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So to roast me for thy dinner;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, a mermaid of Wellamo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once the fair and lovely Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sister dear of Youkahainen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Spake the ancient Wainamoinen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled with sorrow, much regretting:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Since thou’rt Youkahainen’s sister,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beauteous Aino of Pohyola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come to me again I pray thee!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus the mermaid wisely answered:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nevermore will Aino’s spirit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fly to thee and be ill-treated.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quickly dived the water-maiden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the surface of the billow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the many-colored pebbles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the rainbow-tinted grottoes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the mermaids live and linger.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen, not discouraged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thought afresh and well reflected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to live, and work, and win her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew with care his silken fish-net,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To and fro through foam and billow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the bays and winding channels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew it through the placid waters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew it through the salmon-dwellings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the homes of water-maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the waters of Wainola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the blue-back of the ocean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the lakes of distant Lapland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the rivers of Youkola,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the seas of Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hoping thus to find his Aino.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many were the fish he landed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every form of fish-like creatures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he did not catch the sea-maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not Wellamo’s water-maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fairest daughter of the Northland.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Finally the ancient minstrel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mind depressed, and heart discouraged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words, immersed in sorrow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fool am I, and great my folly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Having neither wit nor judgment;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely once I had some knowledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had some insight into wisdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had at least a bit of instinct;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But my virtues all have left me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these mournful days of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vanished with my youth and vigor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Insight gone, and sense departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All my prudence gone to others!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aino, whom I love and cherish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All these years have sought to honor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aino, now Wellamo’s maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Promised friend of mine when needed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Promised bride of mine forever,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once I had within my power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught her in Wellamo’s grottoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led her to my boat of copper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my fish-line made of silver;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But alas! I could not keep her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did not know that I had caught her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till too late to woo and win her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let her slip between my fingers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the home of water-maidens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the kingdom of Wellamo.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wainamoinen then departed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straightway hastened to his country,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To his home in Kalevala,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake these words upon his journey:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What has happened to the cuckoo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once the cuckoo bringing gladness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the morning, in the evening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often bringing joy at noontide?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What has stilled the cuckoo’s singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What has changed the cuckoo’s calling?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sorrow must have stilled his singing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And compassion changed his calling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I hear him sing no longer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For my pleasure in the morning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For my happiness at evening.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never shall I learn the secret,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How to live and how to prosper,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How upon the earth to rest me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How upon the seas to wander!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only were my ancient mother</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Living on the face of Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely she would well advise me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What my thought and what my action,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That this cup of grief might pass me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That this sorrow might escape me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this darkened cloud pass over.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the deep awoke his mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From her tomb she spake as follows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Only sleeping was thy mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now awakes to give thee answer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What thy thought and what thine action,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That this cup of grief may pass thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That this sorrow may escape thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this darkened cloud pass over.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hie thee straightway to the Northland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Visit thou the Suomi daughters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wilt find them wise and lovely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far more beautiful than Aino,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far more worthy of a husband,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not such silly chatter-boxes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the fickle Lapland maidens.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take for thee a life-companion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the honest homes of Suomi,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One of Northland’s honest daughters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She will charm thee with her sweetness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make thee happy through her goodness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Form perfection, manners easy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Every step and movement graceful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of wit and good behavior,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Honor to thy home and kindred.”</span>
